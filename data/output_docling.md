## Abstract

We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeekR1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-ofThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models.

In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912.

However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.

We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.532B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.

## 1.1. Contributions

## Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model

- · We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeekR1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.
- · We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.

## Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too

- · We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.
- · Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeekR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500, and 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous opensource models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.

## 1.2. Summary of Evaluation Results

On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%, performing on par with OpenAI-o1-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. (2) Oncoding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks, as it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in the competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than DeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks.
- · Knowledge : On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeekR1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores of 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its performance is slightly below that of OpenAI-o1-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1 surpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-o1 surpasses 4o on this benchmark.

- · Others : DeepSeek-R1 also excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing, general question answering, editing, summarization, and more. It achieves an impressive length-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on ArenaHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks.

## 2. Approach

## 2.1. Overview

Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models.

## 2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model

Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data , focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights.

## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question 𝑞 , GRPO samples a group of outputs { 𝑜 1, 𝑜 2, · · · , 𝑜 𝐺 } from the old policy 𝜋 𝜃 𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋 𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:

J 𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 ( 𝜃 ) = E [ 𝑞 ∼ 𝑃 ( 𝑄 ) , { 𝑜 𝑖 } 𝐺 𝑖 = 1 ∼ 𝜋 𝜃 𝑜𝑙𝑑 ( 𝑂 | 𝑞 )]

$$1 𝐺 𝐺 ∑︁ 𝑖 = 1 GLYPH<18> min GLYPH<18> 𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) 𝜋 𝜃 𝑜𝑙𝑑 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) 𝐴 𝑖 , clip GLYPH<18> 𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) 𝜋 𝜃 𝑜𝑙𝑑 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) , 1 -𝜀 , 1 + 𝜀 GLYPH<19> 𝐴 𝑖 GLYPH<19> -𝛽 D 𝐾𝐿 GLYPH<0> 𝜋 𝜃 | | 𝜋 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 GLYPH<1> GLYPH<19> , (1)$$

$$D 𝐾𝐿 GLYPH<0> 𝜋 𝜃 | | 𝜋 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 GLYPH<1> = 𝜋 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) 𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) -log 𝜋 𝑟𝑒 𝑓 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) 𝜋 𝜃 ( 𝑜 𝑖 | 𝑞 ) -1, (2)$$

where 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyper-parameters, and 𝐴 𝑖 is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards { 𝑟 1, 𝑟 2, . . . , 𝑟 𝐺 } corresponding to the outputs within each group:

$$𝐴 𝑖 = 𝑟 𝑖 -m 𝑒𝑎𝑛 ({ 𝑟 1, 𝑟 2, · · · , 𝑟 𝐺 }) s 𝑡𝑑 ({ 𝑟 1, 𝑟 2, · · · , 𝑟 𝐺 }) . (3)$$

Aconversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: prompt. Assistant:

## 2.2.2. Reward Modeling

The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards:

- · Accuracy rewards : The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.
- · Format rewards : In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between '<think>' and '</think>' tags.

We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.

## 2.2.3. Training Template

To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biases-such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategies-to ensure that we can accurately observe the model's natural progression during the RL process.

## 2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero

Performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Figure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeekR1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated, DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the RL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant increase, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels comparable to OpenAI-o1-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL algorithm in optimizing the model's performance over time.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero to attain robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model's ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeekR1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zero's performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks.

Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the model's progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.

As depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improve-

ment throughout the training process. This improvement is not the result of external adjustments but rather an intrinsic development within the model. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the ability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time computation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens, allowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated behaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflection-where the model revisits and reevaluates its previous steps-and the exploration of alternative approaches to problem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead emerge as a result of the model's interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This spontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero's reasoning capabilities, enabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy.

Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Aparticularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an 'aha moment'. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model's growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes.

This moment is not only an 'aha moment' for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The 'aha moment' serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future.

Drawback of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning capabilities and autonomously develops unexpected and powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces several issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability, and language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the open community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly cold-start data.

## 2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start

Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.

## 2.3.1. Cold Start

Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators.

In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data

## include:

- · Readability: A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as |special\_token|<reasoning\_process>|special\_token|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results.
- · Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models.

## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning

After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model's performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks.

## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning

When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the model's capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.

Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples.

Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as 'hello' we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning.

We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples.

## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios

To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model's helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.

## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability

To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in §2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.514B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.

For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community.

## 3. Experiment

Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI,

2024d), Aider 1 , LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) (2024-08 - 2025-01), Codeforces 2 , Chinese National High School Mathematics Olympiad (CNMO 2024) 3 , and American Invitational Mathematics Examination 2024 (AIME 2024) (MAA, 2024). In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench.

Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPQA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simpleevals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a "diff" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark.

Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a).

Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@ 𝑘 evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top𝑝 value of 0.95 to generate 𝑘 responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as

$$pass@1 = 1 𝑘 𝑘 ∑︁ 𝑖 = 1 𝑝 𝑖 ,$$

where 𝑝 𝑖 denotes the correctness of the 𝑖 -th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64.

For education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3. This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-o1 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%.

DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a model's ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1's strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. This indicates that

DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks.

On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited.

As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1's outputs enables the efficient DeepSeekR1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform nonreasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32BPreview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here.

## 4. Discussion

## 4.1. Distillation v.s. Reinforcement Learning

In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-R1, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation?

To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale

| QwQ-32B-Preview              | 50.0        | 60.0        | 90.6       | 54.5          | 41.9            |
| DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B    | 47.0        | 60.0        | 91.6       | 55.0          | 40.2            |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B | 72.6        | 83.3        | 94.3       | 62.1          | 57.2            |

RL training, achieves performance on par with QwQ-32B-Preview. However, DeepSeek-R1Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks.

Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and largerscale reinforcement learning.

## 4.2. Unsuccessful Attempts

In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.

Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.

MonteCarlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process.

However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an

exponentially larger search space. To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each node, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model directly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process. Training a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the model to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo's core success relied on training a value model to progressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup due to the complexities of token generation.

In conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a pre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a significant challenge.

## 5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work

In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.

We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instructiontuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.

In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.

- · General Capability: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields.
- · Language Mixing: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates.
- · Prompting Engineering: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results.
- · Software Engineering Tasks: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software engineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement over DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating asynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.

Step  3: But  if  you  filed  with  us  last  year  and  your  PAN  is  already  linked,  you  will  directly  see  this  pre-fill  screen.

<!-- image -->

Step 5: I agree it seems a lot of effort, but it is totally worth it! Look, most of your information has been auto-filled. You just saved nearly  2  hours  of  your  precious  time  -  you  didn't  have  to  manually  fill  in  details  or  get  annoyed  about  silly  typo  errors!

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Step 6: At the bottom, you can see the 'Upload Form 16' option. If you upload your Form 16 here, all your salary details will also be captured  automatically. You  can  also  upload  multiple  Form-16's  if  you  have  switched  jobs  in  the  Financial  Year.

Step 11 : Now let's come to the main income head of ITR-2, the capital gains section. If you have sold assets like stocks, mutual funds, Gold, bonds, shares received as a part of ESOP or RSU scheme, land or building, then the profit/loss from such transactions must be reported under capital gains. ClearTax has partnered with various brokerage firms to capture the capital gains transaction details in the schedule automatically. Step 12: Let's look at each section here. First, is stocks and mutual funds. You will have to obtain a report from your broker and identify the list of sell transactions and the corresponding buy transactions from this report. Then, depending on how long you've held the stocks, you will have to separate them into long-term and short-term and then do the calculations.

<!-- image -->

Step 13: All you have to do is select your stockbroker from the list and log in to your investment account and your capital gains are

## Step  14 :  If

you have done any intraday transactions, we will automatically add them under the business income section as they do not qualify as capital gains. Step 15 : For some brokers, we don't have the login option yet but you can directly drag and drop or upload the P&L report here.

Step 16

: And in case you do not find your broker here (which is in the rarest of rare cases), you can download the excel template

Step  17 :  If  you  have

mutual funds, you should upload CAMS or Karvy P&L report by clicking on their respective icons here. You can also click on the "Mutual funds" tab. Here, you will see CAMS, KARVY, and a few other brokers. Upload the P&L report here and your capital gains will  be  computed. And if you have non-demat mutual funds, you must upload files from both Karvy and CAMS. That should be sufficient. But if you do not have the Excel files or if your broker's name is not shown here, you can add the details manually too.

here.

Step  18 :  If  you  have

<!-- image -->

invested in foreign stocks, then what? Then there is a separate section here. Like shown for stocks, you can either directly import the details from your broker. We support transactions from players like INDMoney, Vested etc. Even if your broker is not mentioned here, you can use our excel template to report all the transactions in a single go. Now comes ESOPs  and RSUs. Let's quickly understand the taxability of ESOPs. In the year when you exercise ESOPs and receive shares, the benefit you receive by getting the shares at a lower price than the market price will be taxed as your salary and TDS will be deducted by your employer. In the year when you sell these shares, the gains/loss will be reported under the capital gains section. This is where capital gains comes into picture.  ("A  bell  icon  or  a  tip  icon  saying,  listen  carefully')  So,  only  if  you  have  sold  the  shares  received  under  ESOP  or  RSU scheme, you can use this section and add all the details like the type of shares (that is whether they are listed or not listed), date of purchase  and  sale  and  value  of  purchase-sale  and  brokerage  expenses.  Your  capital  gains  will  be  calculated.

Step 19

:  Likewise,  you

can add details for all the other assets like Bonds, gold, land and building. Business or profession income is not applicable for ITR2. But if you have any income from a business or profession, you can go ahead and add them here. If your broker provides intra-day transactions in the P&L file, we would have already parsed them and populated them under the Speculative Income section under Business Income as shown earlier. Step 20 : Also, one common error people make while filing ITR is they miss adding income from dividends, savings bank and FD interest. You can add them in the other income sources section. Again, if your broker's p&L statement or your 26AS has it, we will populate it. Otherwise, you can provide the details manually. Step 21 : Now let's move to the

<!-- image -->

Step 23 : If you scroll down, you will find the 'tax-paid' section. All the details of TDS and advance tax that you've paid will appear here. You can also add these details by uploading Form 26AS. If you've bought a car or if you've gone on a foreign vacation, tax may have been collected at source (TCS). That also gets filled from 26AS. And you can get this money back or adjust it with your taxes, who misses this chance

<!-- image -->

Step 24 : Here, you will see a tax summary. Based on all the details you've added, we have auto-selected the ITR Form for you. Also, the best part about filing with us is that we auto-suggest the best tax regime for you that saves you the maximum taxes. You can always compare your tax payable under both regimes and even switch to the other tax regime.

## ITR 3 - What is ITR 3 Form & How to File ITR-3?

By Mohammed S Chokhawala | Updated on: Jul 18th, 2024 | 51 min read The ITR-3 form is specifically designed for individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) engaged in business or profession, necessitating the maintenance of comprehensive books of accounts. This category encompasses professionals such as chartered accountants, doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc., whose income is calculated based on actual profits. Moreover, individuals earning from salaried employment and additional sources like freelancing or part-time business activities can also use the ITR-3 form to file their income tax returns.

## What is the ITR-3 Form?

The ITR-3 is applicable for individual and HUF who have income from profits and gains from business or profession. One can call it a master Form, as this is the one form where an individual or HUF can report all the possible incomes.

## Who can file ITR-3 Form?

- Carrying on a business or profession (both tax audit and non-audit cases)
- The return may include income from house property, salary/pension, capital gains and income from other sources.
- Remuneration received from a partnership firm

## Who is not eligible to file ITR-3 Form?

- No persons other than individuals & HUF are eligible to file ITR -3 Form.
- Individuals & HUFs not having income by way of business or profession or partnership firm are not eligible to file the ITR-3 Form.

## Due date for filing the ITR-3 form

For non-audit cases, the due date to file ITR-3 is 31st July and for accounts requiring audit, the due date is 31st October.

## Major Changes in ITR-3 form for AY 2023-24 and AY 2024-25

Below changes are incorporated in the ITR-3 form of the FY 2022-23 and applicable for FY 2023-24 as well: * A new schedule VDA has been added to separately report your income from crypto/ other VDAs. If you treat income from VDAs as capital gains, a quarterly breakup will need to be given under the Capital Gains Schedule. In the new ITR-3 every VDA transaction will have to be reported along with the dates of sale and purchase. * A few questions have been added in the new ITR 3 form to determine if you had  opted  out  of  the  New  Tax  Regime  in  previous  years. *  Foreign  institutional  investors  (FII/FPI)  must  provide  their  SEBI registration number as an additional disclosure measure. * There has been a small change in balance sheet reporting. According to the new ITR-3 form, advances received from individuals specified in Sec 40A(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act and others must be reported under the 'Advances' heading in Source of Funds. * Turnover and income from intraday trading must be reported under the newly introduced section 'Trading Account'.

## 25 (AY 2025-26)

By Ektha Surana  | Updated on: Jan 7th, 2025 | 5 min read ITR stands for Income Tax Return. The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) releases all the ITR forms and specifies the procedures to be followed. This article provides an in-depth understanding of the definition of ITR and the types of ITR forms.

## What is ITR?

Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form in which the taxpayers file information about their income earned and tax applicable, to the income tax department. The department has notified 7 forms i.e. ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, ITR-4, ITR-5, ITR-6 & ITR-7 to date. Every taxpayer should file his ITR on or before the specified due date. The applicability of ITR forms varies depending on the sources of income of the taxpayer, the amount of the income earned and the category of the taxpayer like individuals, HUF, company, etc.

## What happens when you file wrong ITR form?

Filing the wrong Income Tax Return (ITR) form can lead to a few complications, but there are also solutions to rectify the situation. Here's what you need to know: * Rejection of ITR: The Income Tax Department might reject your return if it's filed in an incorrect form.  This  can  cause  delays  in  processing  and  potential  penalties  for  late  filing  (if  the  deadline  has  passed). *  Scrutiny  or Assessment: Even if your return isn't rejected, using the wrong form could trigger additional scrutiny from the tax authorities. They might ask you to re-file using the correct form.

The final and crucial step is to verify your return. Failure to verify is equivalent to not filing at all. Choose from verification methods

like Aadhaar OTP, electronic verification code (EVC), Net Banking, or sending a physical copy of ITR-V to CPC, Bengaluru.

## Filing Income Tax Return for Previous Years

To  file  your  income  tax  return  for  previous  years,  you  can  utilize  the  ITR  U  form.  However,  there  are  specific  conditions  and limitations regarding eligibility and the duration during which ITR-U can be employed.

## Understanding Belated Return

A Belated Return refers to filing your income tax return after the original due date has passed. For instance, you can file a Belated Return if you can't submit your ITR by the initial deadline of 31st July for the financial year 2022-23. This allows you to submit your return after the original due date but before the extended deadline, typically until 31st December.

## Late Filing Fees under Section 234F:

Starting from the fiscal year 2017-18, a late filing fee is applicable if you submit your income tax returns after the due date, as outlined in Section 234F. For instance, consider the due date for filing returns for the fiscal year 2021-22, set at 31st July 2022. If you miss this deadline and opt for a belated return, you can file until 31st December 2022. However, it's important to note that a late filing  penalty  will  be  imposed.  If  you  file  your  ITR  after  the  due  date  (31st  July  2022)  but  before  the  extended  deadline  (31st December 2022), a maximum penalty of Rs 5,000 will be levied. However, a provision exists to provide relief to small taxpayers. If your total income does not exceed Rs 5 lakh, the maximum penalty for the delay will be capped at Rs 1,000. Note: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for corporates to file income tax returns for the Assessment Year (AY) 2024-25 from October 31, 2024, to November 15, 2024 . This extension follows an earlier adjustment by the government, which shifted the tax audit report submission deadline from September 30, 2024, to October 7, 2024. Make sure to file your ITR by the revised due date to avoid penalties and potential legal issues.

## Checklist for filing ITR 2024

Before filing your ITR for 2024, a little preparation must be done to ensure a smooth ITR filing process. Here's a checklist: 1. Verify AIS and Form 26AS:

- The Income Tax Department (ITD) provides Form 26AS, a record of your Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on various incomes and taxes you've directly paid. The Income tax department recently providing the Annual Information Statement (AIS), summing up your data on financial transactions made during the year.
- The AIS contains various useful data regarding your finances, such as your specified financial transactions, property purchase and sale, mutual funds and transactions in shares, credit card payments, bank fixed deposits, deposited amount in your bank account, saving bank interest, etc.

## How to Use these documents for ITR filing:

- You can access both documents on the Income Tax Department website.
- Verify the details in Form 26AS match your TDS information and that the AIS reflects your financial transactions accurately.
- This helps identify missed income (like bank FD interest) and ensures accurate TDS details for carry-forward.
- Report any discrepancies in the AIS through online feedback.

## Verify Form 16/16A:

- By now, you should have received Form 16 (from your employer) or Form 16A (from other sources) for TDS.

## For Form 16:

- Double-check your PAN details, especially if it's your first year with the employer.
- Ensure exempt allowances like HRA and LTA are correctly reflected (if you opted for the old tax regime).
- Discrepancies arise if you don't submit documents on time, leading to taxable deductions.
- Verify various deductions for payments like insurance premiums, home loan repayments, etc., are accurate.
- This is crucial as your Chartered Accountant might rely solely on Form 16 while filing.
- Report any errors to your employer for correction.

## For Form 16A:

- Similar to Form 16, verify PAN details, income amount, and TDS mentioned.

## Open a Capital Gains Account (if applicable):

- If  you  have taxable long-term capital gains and plan to avail of tax exemption under sections 54 or 54F by investing in a house, you can do so even after the ITR due date.
- However, to avoid future complications, you must deposit the unutilised amount in a capital gains account with specified banks by the due date.
- So, even if you delay filing your ITR, prioritise depositing the unutilized amount in this account.
- Scrutinize Various Statements:
- Obtain annual account statements from your broker, mutual fund house, and bank.
- Verify that all transactions reflected in these statements are correctly incorporated into your ITR income statement.

These steps will prepare you for a smooth ITR filing experience in 2024.

The Income Tax Act, 1961, and the Income Tax Rules, 1962, require citizens to file their tax returns with the Income Tax Department at the end of every financial year and this form is a part of the filing process as specified by the Government of India. The due date for filing return with the Income Tax Department of India is 31 July every year. This is subject to change only if a directive to this effect is issued by the Income Tax Department or the Ministry of Finance, India. The Financial Year ends on 31 March every year so Assessees have a period of four months to prepare their Income Tax Returns.

ITR filing page of ClearTax
Create an Account or Login with ClearTax
Create a new account or simply click on Login if you are already a user of ClearTax.

Create an account or Login
Link Your PAN
Linking your PAN allows us to submit your return to the income tax department. 

If you are filing with us for the first time, you need to link your PAN by entering your PAN, Date of Birth, and the OTP received on your registered mobile number. You can verify the OTP using either your 'Aadhaar registered mobile number' or ‘IT Department registered mobile number.’

Link your Pan to e-file
Pre-fill Your Personal Information
If you have previously filed with Cleartax and your PAN is already linked, you will directly see the autofill screen. To pre-fill your information from the income tax department, you will need to complete another OTP verification. This OTP verification is to capture all your personal information and income details in your income tax return with maximum security of your data.


If you choose the 'IT Department' option, you will need to enter two OTPs, one sent to your mobile number and the other to your email.

Too many OTPs can seem a lot of effort, but it is totally worth it! Most of your information will be auto-filled. This saves you nearly 2 hours of your time that would have been spent manually entering and correcting details. Review the auto-filled information and modify if necessary.

Pre-fill information
Upload Form 16
Scroll down and find the 'Upload Form 16' option. By uploading your Form 16, your salary details will be automatically captured. If you do not have Form 16, you can still proceed directly to e-filing by clicking on “Continue to e-file”. You can also upload multiple Form-16's if you have switched jobs in the Financial Year.

Form 16 upload
Form 16 successful

ClearTax will then automatically calculate your income along with the exemptions, deductions, etc., based on the details provided in FORM-16. You will now be redirected to this page, where you can see all your personal details, such as your name, address, bank details, etc.

Note: If you prefer skipping the pre-fill option, you can manually enter the details.

Here, you will see 4 tabs: Personal Info, Income Sources, Tax Saving and Tax Summary. 

Personal Information
All your personal details like name, address and other details will appear here. You can expand each section and review these details. You also have the option to edit them, if required. 

Personal Information 
Income Sources
Go to the ‘Income Sources’ tab. 

Salary
If you didn't upload Form 16 earlier, you can upload it here and fill in the salary details.

Salary Income
Rental Income or House property
Enter the income from house property, considering whether you occupy the house or have rented it out.

Income from House property
Capital gain
If you have sold assets like stocks, mutual funds, Gold, bonds, shares received as a part of ESOP or RSU scheme, land or building, then the profit/loss from such transactions must be reported under capital gains section. 

Capital gains

1. Stocks and Mutual Funds: 
Simply choose your stockbroker from the available options and log in to your investment account. Your capital gains will be calculated within seconds. Cleartax can effortlessly import and process thousands of transactions from your profit and loss (P&L) report to accurately determine the capital gains amount.
If you have done any intraday transactions, they will be automatically categorized as business income rather than capital gains. 
We don’t have the login option for some brokers yet, but you can directly drag and drop or upload the P&L report here. 
If your broker is not listed, you can download the excel template, fill in the required details, and upload the completed template.
For mutual funds, you should upload the P&L report from CAMS or Karvy by selecting their respective icons. You can also navigate to the "Mutual Funds" tab, where you will find CAMS, KARVY, and a few other brokers. Upload the P&L report here and your capital gains will be computed. If you have non-demat mutual funds, please upload files from both Karvy and CAMS. However, if you don't have the excel files or if your broker's name is not listed, you can manually add the details as well.
2. US or foreign stocks
A separate section is dedicated to reporting capital gain details from foreign stocks. Similar to stocks, you can either import the details directly from your broker. Currently, we support transactions from brokers like INDMoney and Vested. Even if your broker isn't mentioned, you can use our excel template to report all the transactions at once.

3. ESOPs and RSUs
If you have sold the shares received under ESOP or RSU scheme, you can add the following details under this section:

type of shares (that is, whether they are listed or not listed), 
date of purchase and sale and 
value of purchase-sale and brokerage expenses. 
Your capital gains will be calculated. 

Likewise, you can add details for all the other assets like Bonds, gold, land and buildings

Professional, Freelancing and Business Income
So broadly, there are 5 sub-sections here:

The first section is 44ADA- this is for professionals. 
The income tax law has specified a few professions and made it clear that only these professionals can opt for 44ADA: 
- Legal
- Medical
- Engineering
- Architecture
- Accountancy
- Technical Consultancy
- Interior Decoration
- Film Artists like cameraman, producer, editor, actor, director, singer, etc are specified.

Under the “Nature of Business”, you will find approximately 40 codes. Select the appropriate code. If you're unsure of the code, simply search for your profession. Also, mention the trade name and description. If you have multiple professions, you can include them all. 
The next condition here is that your revenue should be less than equal to 75 lakhs. If your revenue is more than 75 lakhs, you will have to file taxes normally and you will not be eligible to opt for the presumptive scheme. Revenue is nothing but the total amount you have received for the service offered. It is also called gross receipts. Some folks call it consultation fees. For example, if you are  a practicing lawyer and your clients pay you 1 lakh rupees towards a case, that 1 lakh would be considered as Revenue. 
The other condition is that your expenses cannot be more than 50% i.e. by default it is assumed that your expenses or cost will not be more than 50% of your income. Say your revenue is 20 lakhs, then your expenses has to be up to 10 lakhs. You can show a lower amount say 7 lakhs, then you’ll pay taxes on 13 lakhs but you cannot show a higher amount than 10 lakhs. Let’s add 12 lakhs. If you enter an incorrect amount, you will see error prompts immediately which will guide you whether you are eligible for the presumptive scheme or not. So there is no scope of mistake here.

You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.
Now let’s look at the second section, i.e. 44AD
44AD is mainly for small businesses say a private tutor, web designer, freelance content writer, small business owners. Just like there were some conditions under 44ADA, there are some conditions for 44AD too. 
- The first condition is that your turnover, i.e. nothing but your sales, must be less than 3 crores and 
- the second condition is that your profit must be more than or equal to 8% of your turnover. So if your revenue is say 1 crore, then your profit should be atleast 8 lakhs and you will have to pay taxes on this profit.
But if you have received the money through digital means, then you can pay taxes on only 6% profit instead of 8%. Even if you have received them through Phonepe or GooglePay, that would be considered as digital means. Here again, you will have to select the nature of business, trade name etc There are nearly 200 codes you can choose from.
Add the sales amount you’ve received through digital and non-digital modes separately here. The profit for digital transactions should be atleast 6% and for non-digital it should be atleast 8%. Now you can fill up the assets and liabilities details and proceed. 
There will be some freelancers who would be working independently and running unrelated small businesses too. So they can declare income under both 44AD and 44ADA, as long as the conditions are met.
If your revenue and expense conditions are not met, then you can fill in all the details under the third section. We will automatically select the correct ITR form for you, i.e. ITR-3.
You can add all your other business income here and fill up the Balance sheet and P&L
You have to fill all the Financial particulars if you have the presumptive income. You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why is income tax return filing important?

The income tax department has mandated to file the return to individuals only in case their income is above the basic exemption limit or if they meet specific criteria like expenditure on foreign travel is more than Rs 2 lakh and electricity consumption of Rs 1 lakh or more, deposits of an amount/aggregate of an amount above Rs 1 crore in one or more current accounts, and other conditions that the government will notify.

Later, the government provided additional conditions via a notification dated 21st April 2022. It has notified below conditions where the taxpayer is required to file ITR: 

Total business turnover/sales/gross receipts during the FY exceeds Rs 60 lakh.
Total gross receipts of the profession exceed Rs 10 lakh during the FY.
The aggregate of TDS and TCS during the FY is Rs 25000 or more (for senior citizens, there is an increased limit of Rs 50,000).
Total savings bank account deposits are Rs 50 lakh or more during the FY.
Other scenarios where it is mandatory to file ITR includes:

In the case of a resident whose asset is located outside India or has signing authority for an account based outside India. It is always good to file your ITR even if you are not eligible due to the benefits.

Filing of ITR creates a valid proof of income.
ITR is required for applying for any loan in the future.
Banks require ITR even for applying for credit cards.
ITR is required for VISA applications, etc.

What is income tax?

Income tax is a direct tax on your income. It means a portion of your income is paid to the government. The government charges this amount for expenditures related to health, education, providing subsidies to agriculture, infrastructure etc. It is paid by an individual/HUF/any taxpayer depending on income levels or gains in a financial year. A company has to pay income tax irrespective of the level of income. The government passes laws prescribing the rate of taxation on your income from time to time.

How to pay income tax online?

You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return. If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf. If you are liable to pay advance tax, you have to pay 90% of it before the 31st of March every financial year. You can file your ITR once the financial year ends.
The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date. It’s worthwhile noting that you attract a late filing fee of Rs 5,000 on failing to file ITR within the due date of the assessment year.

What is Advance Tax?


For salaried individuals, advance tax is mostly taken care of through TDS by employers.

One's tax liability needs to be estimated beforehand. If tax amounts to more than Rs.10,000/- per year, taxpayers need to pay advance tax in quarterly instalments (June, September, December and March).

Will I get a refund if I have paid excess tax?

Here's a detailed list of exemptions and deductions available under the Old vs New Regime.

Old Tax Regime Vs New Tax Regime - Which is Better?
The new tax regime can largely benefit middle-class taxpayers who have a taxable income of up to Rs 15 lakh. The old regime is a better option for high-income earners.

The new income tax regime is beneficial for people who make low investments. As the new regime offers six lower-income tax slabs, anyone paying taxes without claiming tax deductions can benefit from paying a lower rate of tax under the new tax regime. For instance, the assessee having total income before deduction up to Rs 12 lakh will have higher tax liability under the old system if they have investments less than Rs. 3,12,500. Therefore, if you invest less in tax-saving schemes, go for the new regime.

That being said, if you already have in place a financial plan for wealth creation by making investments in tax-saving instruments; medical claims and life insurance; making payments of children’s tuition fees; payment of EMIs on education loan; buying a house with a home loan; and so on, the old regime helps you with higher tax deductions and lower tax outgo.

In light of the above and considering the new income tax regime, if taxpayers want to opt for the concessional tax rates, they may evaluate both regimes. Hence, it is advisable to do a comparative evaluation and analysis under both regimes and then choose the most beneficial one, as it may vary from person to person. Read a detailed breakdown on this topic here.

When Can I Opt for Old vs New Regime?

What are the consequences of non e-verifying income tax return?


It is required to either e-verify the return or send it by making the signature physically to CPC, Income Tax Department, Bengaluru within 30 days of filing the return. Failing to do so will result in invalidation of return, which means the return will be considered as having never been filed.

If the return is verified after 30 days, the date of e-verification will be considered as the date of filing, and if such date falls after the due date, then

the late filing fees of Rs.5000/Rs.1000 will be levied.
The tax regime shall be switched to the default regime, and the return will be processed. (For FY 2023-24, if the new tax regime was opted out, then the return will be processed under the new tax regime (default regime) by disallowing the ineligible exemptions and deductions.

ITR stands for Income Tax Return. The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) releases all the ITR forms and specifies the procedures to be followed. This article provides an in-depth understanding of the definition of ITR and the types of ITR forms.

What is ITR?
Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form in which the taxpayers file information about their income earned and tax applicable, to the income tax department.

The department has notified 7 forms i.e. ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, ITR-4, ITR-5, ITR-6 & ITR-7 to date. Every taxpayer should file his ITR on or before the specified due date. The applicability of ITR forms varies depending on the sources of income of the taxpayer, the amount of the income earned and the category of the taxpayer like individuals, HUF, company, etc.

Which ITR should I file?
Why Should You File ITR?
If you want to claim an income tax refund from the department.
If you have earned from or have invested in foreign assets during the FY.
If you wish to apply for a visa or a loan
If the taxpayer is a company or a firm, irrespective of profit or loss.
If you have a loss from business/profession or under capital gains head, you will not be allowed to carry them forward to the next years unless you file the return before the due date.
When is it Mandatory to File Income Tax Returns (ITR) in India?
If your gross total income is more than the basic exemption limit-
Basic Exemption Limit under the old tax regime is as follows -

Age Group	Basic Exemption Limit
For individuals below 60 years	Rs 2.5 lakh
For individuals above 60 years but below 80 years	Rs 3.0 lakh
For individuals above 80 years	Rs 5.0 lakh
Irrespective of age, basic exemption limit under the new tax regime is Rs.3 Lakh.

If your income is below the basic exemption limit, you will still be required to file your tax return if you meet any of these conditions:
Deposited more than Rs 1 crore in 'current' bank account: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have deposited a total of Rs. 1 crore or more in one or more current accounts with a bank. However, no such requirement has been specified for deposits made in the post office current account; or
Deposited more than Rs 50 lakh in 'savings' bank account: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have deposited a total amount of Rs 50 lakh or more in one or more of your savings bank accounts.
Spent more than Rs 2 lakh on foreign travel: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have incurred a total expenditure of more than Rs 2 lakh on foreign travel whether for yourself or any other person; or
Electricity expenditure is more than Rs 1 lakh: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have incurred more than Rs.1 lakh towards electricity consumption during the previous year; or
TDS or TCS is more than Rs 25,000: If the tax deducted at source (TDS)/ tax collected at source (TCS) exceeds Rs 25,000 in the previous year. In the case of a senior citizen (above 60 years), this limit is Rs 50,000.
Business turnover is more than Rs 60 lakh: In case you are a businessman and your total sales, turnover, or gross receipt is more than Rs 60 lakh during the previous year, then you have to mandatorily file a tax return
Professional income is more than Rs 10 lakh: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you are engaged in a profession and your gross receipts are more than Rs 10 lakh during the previous year.

The government introduced various incentives in the recent times to encourage the adoption of the new regime. 

These changes show that the government intends to have taxpayers transition to the new regime and eventually phase out the old one. Though the new regime is now the default tax regime, the old tax regime will continue to exist.

Budget 2025 Update
The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how!

The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows:

Note: First column contains income levels and first row contains deduction amount.

Current Tax Rates under New Tax Regime
New Tax Regime
A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D , and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in the Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes, which remain the same even for FY 2024-2025 since no changes were made in the Interim Budget 2024, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime. They are:

Higher Tax Rebate Limit: Full tax rebate on an income up to ₹7 lakhs is allowed. Whereas this threshold is ₹5 lakhs under the old tax regime. This means that taxpayers with an income of up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay any tax at all under the new tax regime! 
Streamlined Tax Slabs: The tax exemption limit is up-to ₹3 lakhs, and the new tax slabs are:

Salary income: The standard deduction of ₹50,000, which was only available under the old regime, has now been extended to the new tax regime as well. This amount has been increased to ₹75,000 for the new regime only with effect from FY 2024-25.
Family pension: Those receiving a family pension can claim a deduction of ₹15,000 or 1/3rd of the pension, whichever is lower. This amount has been increased to ₹25,000 for the new regime with effect from FY 2024-25.
Reduced Surcharge for High Net Worth Individuals: The surcharge rate on income over ₹5 crores has been reduced from 37% to 25%. This move will bring down their effective tax rate from 42.74% to 39%. 
Higher Leave Encashment Exemption: The exemption limit for non-government employees has been raised from ₹3 lakhs to ₹25 lakhs, an 8-fold increase.
Default Regime: Starting from FY 2023-24, the new income tax regime will be set as the default option. If you want to continue using the old regime, you must submit the income tax return along with Form 10-IEA before the due date. You will have the option to switch between the two regimes annually to check the tax benefits.
Old Tax Regime
The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime.

Difference Between Old Vs New Tax Regime: Which is Better for FY 2024-25?
The decision to switch to the new or remain in the old tax regime or which regime is better for you shall be based on the tax savings deductions and exemptions you are eligible for in the old tax regime. To make it easier, we have calculated a breakeven point for various income levels (refer to the table below) for a salaried individual below 60 years of age. This can be used to determine which regime to choose.

The Breakeven Threshold for Deciding Between New vs Old Tax Regimes for FY 2023-24
The Breakeven point is the amount at which there will be no difference in tax liability between the two tax regimes. 

If your total eligible deductions and exemptions in the old tax regime are higher than the breakeven threshold for your income level, it is advisable to stay in the old regime. On the other hand, if the breakeven threshold is higher, then moving to the new tax regime is more beneficial.

How to Choose Between Old and New Tax Regimes?
When deciding between the two tax regimes, it is important to take into account the tax exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime. After deducting all eligible exemptions and deductions, the net taxable income can be determined. By calculating the tax liability based on this net taxable income under the old tax regime, it becomes possible to compare it with the tax liability under the new tax regime.

Choosing the regime with the lower tax liability is the logical approach, and it is essential to inform the employer about this choice so that the appropriate Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) can be deducted from the salary.

If you have a loss from house property, capital gains, or business & profession, you need to consider them as well while making informed decisions on the selection of regime. Along with the current year's losses, even the previous year's losses eligible to set off will get lapsed as well. Ineligibility to carry forward such losses may impact your future income determination and taxes thereon.

Conclusion
Many individuals often find themselves questioning the disparities between the old and new tax regimes. The new income tax regime is designed to accommodate those who have more personal commitments such as repayment of personal/vehicle loans, medical treatment of parents or dependents, or wish to avoid the burden of extensive tax preparation or have minimal tax deductions due to their ineligibility for section 10 exemptions, standard deductions, tax on employment, employer contribution to pension scheme etc., Conversely, the old tax regime can yield more tax savings for senior citizens, who derive a substantial portion of their income from interest, can benefit from Section 80TTB, which allows them to claim Rs.50,000 as interest income deduction and feel more secure under the old tax regime.

Both the old and new tax regimes possess advantages and disadvantages. The previous tax structure encourages taxpayers to cultivate a habit of saving, while the new tax structure favours employees with lower earnings and investments, resulting in fewer deductions and exemptions. The new tax system is considered safer and simpler, involving fewer records and reducing the potential for tax evasion fraud. However, due to the unique nature of individual deductions and exemptions, a thorough comparison of the two regimes is necessary to determine the best fit for each person.

Interest
If you submit your return after the deadline, you will be liable to pay interest at a rate of 1% per month or part month on the unpaid tax amount as per Section 234A.

Late fee
In case of late filing, Section 234F imposes a late fee of Rs.5,000, which shall be reduced to Rs.1,000 if your total income is below Rs.5 lakh.

Loss Adjustment
In case you have incurred losses from sources like the stock market, mutual funds, properties, or any of your businesses, you have the option to carry them forward and offset them against your income in the subsequent year. This provision substantially reduces your tax liability in future years. However, you will not be allowed to carry forward these losses if you miss filing your ITR before the deadline.

What if ITR Filing is Missed?
Belated Return
If you miss the ITR filing due date, you can file a return after the due date, called a belated return. However, you will still have to pay the late fee and interest charges, and you will not be allowed to carry forward any losses for future adjustments. The last date for filing a belated return is 31st December of the assessment year (unless extended by the government). 

Updated Return
Still, if you miss the 31st December deadline due to unavoidable reasons still you can file the updated (ITR U) return subject to the conditions specified therein. Click here to know more.

What are Financial Year (FY) and Assessment Year (AY)?
The return you will file in the upcoming year is for the income you earned in FY 2024-25, i.e. for the income earned between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025. The assessment year is the review year for FY 2024-2025, where you file your returns and declare your returns by declaring all the incomes, exemptions, deductions, losses etc., already made or incurred during the year for tax assessment. For the income earned during the FY (here FY 2024-25), the assessment year would be the immediately next year, i.e. 1st April 2025 to 31st March 2026. Hence, the assessment year would be AY 2025-26.

An Income Tax Refund is issued by the Income Tax Department if a taxpayer has paid more income tax than was due for the financial year. Individuals/Businesses pay income tax through TDS deducted, advance tax on the basis of anticipated liability, or self-assessment tax which might exceed the actual tax liability. In some cases, an income tax refund can also arise in case the tax liability is reduced by claiming deductions, exemptions, set off of losses, or tax credits while filing the income tax return.

Post-filing, the Income Tax Authorities assess the taxpayer's tax liability. In case the tax liability assessed exceeds the amount paid, the excess tax paid is refunded to the taxpayer along with interest at 0.5% per month or part of the month (i.e. 6% per annum) until the date of refund.

How to Calculate the Income Tax Refund with Example?
If you paid more taxes than you were required to pay, you can claim the additional amount as an income tax refund.

Income Tax Refund = Total Taxes paid – Total tax liability 

If the taxes paid (either by way of Advance Tax or TDS or TCS or Self-Assessment Tax) are more than the actual tax amount due, then the excess tax paid can be claimed as a refund. The income tax department will recompute the taxes and validate the refund claim before initiating the refund.

For example: Assume Mr. Gupta paid 3 lakh as an advance tax during the financial year. At the end of the financial year, he learns his tax liability is only 2 lakh. He can request a refund by filing an income tax return (ITR). If the assessing officer approves his request, the excess tax amount of 1 lakh will be credited to Mr Gupta's pre-validated bank account.

3 lakh Advance Tax - 2 lakh Tax liability = 1 lakh Tax refund for Mr. Gupta 

The excess amount will be refunded along with interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of the month. If the refund is received in September, then interest of Rs. 3,000 (1,00,000*0.5%*6) will also be credited to the bank account.

How to Claim an Income Tax Refund?

To get your income tax refund or TDS refund, all you need to do is file your Income Tax Return and declare your income, deduction and tax paid details to the Income Tax Department. Once the ITR is processed successfully and if there is any excess tax, it will be issued in your prevalidated bank account. Follow the process and file your ITR via Cleartax.

Process to file on Cleartax

The time taken to receive the income tax refund entirely depends on the Income Tax Department’s internal process. Generally, it takes around 7 to 120 days, with an average time of 90 days after you have e-verified your return. The Income Tax Department implemented a new refund processing system to enable faster refund processing with an expected turnaround of a few days instead of a few months.        
Consistent with this objective, the average ITR processing duration has been reduced to 10 days for returns submitted in the AY 2023-24, as opposed to 82 days for returns submitted in the AY 2019-20 and 16 days for returns submitted in AY 2022-23.

Refunds sent through cheques are dispatched to the address mentioned in the ITR through speed post.

What is the Interest on Income Tax Refund?

When the refund amount is more than 10% of the total tax payable for that particular year, you will receive a simple interest on the tax refund. Interest is computed at 6% per annum (0.5% per month or part of the month) on the refund amount. Here's how the interest on refund is computed:

Calculate interest on refund @0.5% per month

How to Claim Refund for Missed ITR Filing on Due Date?

Investment in a immovable property, predominantly house is one of the most sought-after investments primarily because you get to own a house. While others may invest with the intention of earning a profit upon selling the property in the future. It is important to note that a house property is regarded as a capital asset for income tax purposes. Consequently, any gain or loss incurred from the sale of an immovable property may be subject to tax under the 'Capital Gains' head. Similarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investments. We will delve into the chapter on ‘Capital gains’ in detail here.

What is Capital Gains Tax in India?
Any profit or gain that arises from the sale of a ‘capital asset’ is known as ‘income from capital gains’. Such capital gains are taxable in the year in which the transfer of the capital asset takes place. This is called capital gains tax. There are two types of Capital Gains: short-term capital gains(STCG) and long-term capital gains(LTCG).

Defining Capital Assets
Land, building, house property, vehicles, patents, trademarks, leasehold rights, machinery, and jewellery are a few examples of capital assets. This includes having rights in or in relation to an Indian company. It also includes the rights of management or control or any other legal right.

 The following do not come under the category of capital asset:

a. Any stock, consumables or raw material, held for the purpose of business or profession

b. Personal goods such as clothes and furniture held for personal use

c. Agricultural land in rural(*) India

d. 6½% gold bonds (1977) or 7% gold bonds (1980) or National Defence gold bonds (1980) issued by the central government

e. Special bearer bonds (1991)

f. Gold deposit bond issued under the gold deposit scheme (1999) or deposit certificates issued under the Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 and Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2019 notified by the Central Government.

*Definition of rural area (effective from AY 2014-15) – Any area which is outside the jurisdiction of a municipality or cantonment board, having a population of 10,000 or more is considered a rural area. Also, it should not fall within a distance given below

2

> 2 kms but < 6 kms

> 1,00,000

3

> 6 kms but < 8 kms

> 10,00,000

 


Types of Capital Assets?
1. STCA ( Short-term capital asset ) An asset held for a period of 24 months or less is a short-term capital asset. So, if you sell the asset within a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a short-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the holding period is reduced to 24 months and 12 months. 

Some assets are considered short-term capital assets when these are held for 12 months or less. This rule is applicable if the date of transfer is after 10th July 2014 (irrespective of what the date of purchase is). These assets are:

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
2. LTCA ( Long-term capital asset ): An asset held for more than 24 months is a long-term capital asset. They will be classified as a long-term capital asset if held for more than 24 months as earlier. So, if you sell the asset after a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a long-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the applicable holding period is 12 months. 

Capital assets such as land, building and house property shall be considered as long-term capital asset if the owner holds it for a period of 24 months or more (from FY 2017-18).

Whereas, below-listed assets if held for a period of more than 12 months, shall be considered as long-term capital asset.

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
Note: Capital gains from the sale of units of a specified mutual fund acquired on or after April 1, 2023, and market-linked debentures will always be treated as short-term capital gains, regardless of how long they have been held.

How to Calculate Short-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Cost of acquisition
Cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54B/54D

Step 4: This amount is a short-term capital gain to be taxed

Short-term capital gain =	Full value consideration   
Less: Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer( for e.g. brokerage on sale)   
Less: Cost of acquisition   
Less: Cost of improvement
How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Indexed cost of acquisition
Indexed cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54, 54D, 54EC, 54F, and 54B 

Long-term capital gain=	Full value consideration   
Less : Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer   
Less: Indexed cost of acquisition   
Less: Indexed cost of improvement   
Less: Expenses that can be deducted from full value for consideration*
(*Expenses from sale proceeds from a capital asset, that wholly and directly relate to the sale or transfer of the capital asset are allowed to be deducted. These are the expenses which are necessary for the transfer to take place.)

Exception: 

Long-term capital gains on the sale of equity shares/ units of equity oriented fund, realised after 31st March 2018, will remain exempt up to Rs. 1.25 lakh per annum.
If the transfer happened on or before 23/07/2024, tax at @ 10% will be levied only on LTCG on shares/units of equity oriented fund exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh in one financial year without the benefit of indexation.
If the transfer happened after 23/07/2024, tax rate is 12.5%. Exemption of Rs. 1.25 Lakh available.
Deductible Expenses
A. Sale of house property: These expenses are deductible from the total sale price:

Brokerage or commission paid for securing a purchaser
Cost of stamp papers
Travelling expenses in connection with the transfer – these may be incurred after the transfer has been affected
Where property has been inherited, expenditure incurred with respect to procedures associated with the will and inheritance, obtaining succession certificate, costs of the executor, may also be allowed in some cases
B. Sale of shares: You may be allowed to deduct these expenses:

Broker’s commission related to the shares sold
STT or securities transaction tax is not allowed as a deductible expense
C. Where jewellery is sold: In case of sale of broker’s jewellery and where a broker’s services were involved in securing a buyer, the cost of these services can be deducted.

Note: The expenses deducted from the sale price of assets for calculating capital gains are not allowed as a deduction under any other head of income, and you can claim them only once.

Indexed Cost of Acquisition/Improvement
The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.   
Refer to this page for the complete list of CII.  

The indexed cost of acquisition is calculated as:

Indexed cost of   
acquisition =	(Cost of acquisition X   
CII of the year in which the asset is transferred ) /   
CII of the year in which the asset was first held by the seller or FY 2001-02, whichever is later   
 
The cost of acquisition of the assets acquired before 1st April 2001 should be actual cost or FMV as on 1st April 2001, as per taxpayer’s option.

The indexed cost of improvement is calculated as:

Indexed cost of improvement =	Cost of improvement x CII (year of asset transfer) / CII (year of asset improvement)
Note: Improvements made before 1st April 2001, should not be considered.

Note: The indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

Exemption on Capital Gains
Example: Manya bought a house in July 2004 for Rs.50 lakh, and the full value of consideration received in FY 2016-17 is Rs.1.8 crore.   
Capital asset type: Since this property has been held for over 2 years, this would be a long-term capital asset.

Cost of acquisition: The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken. Using the indexed cost of acquisition formula, the adjusted cost of the house is Rs 1.17 crore. (Refer CII here for the calculations)

Capital gain: Hence, the net capital gain is Rs 63, 00,000.

Tax: Long-term capital gains on sale of house property are taxed at 20%. For a net capital gain of Rs 63, 00,000, the total tax outgo will be Rs.12,97,800.

This is a significant amount of money to be paid out in taxes. This can be lowered by taking benefit of exemptions provided by the Income Tax Act on capital gains when profit from the sale is reinvested into buying another asset.

Section 54: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Purchase of Another House Property
Budget 2019 announcement!  

Capital gains exemption under Section 54: Taxpayers can get an exemption from long-term capital gain from the sale of house property by investing in up to two house properties against the earlier provision of one house property with same conditions. However, the capital gain on the sale of house property must not exceed Rs 2 crores.

The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).

The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on sale.

Conditions for availing this benefit:

The new property can be purchased either 1 year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property.
The gains can also be invested in the construction of a property, but construction must be completed within three years from the date of sale.
In the Budget for 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the capital gains to claim this exemption.
Please note that this exemption can be taken back if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase/completion of construction.
The capital gains tax exemption limit under Section 54 to 54F is restricted to Rs.10 crore. Earlier, there was no threshold.

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  then One residential house property should be purchased within 1 year before the date of sale of house property or 2 years after the date of sale of house property; (OR) Construct a house property within 3 years after the date of sale of house property.

Section 54F: Exemption on capital gains on sale of any asset other than a house property
Exemption under Section 54F is available when there are capital gains from the sale of a long-term asset other than a house property. You must invest the entire sale consideration and not only capital gain to buy a new residential house property to claim this exemption. Purchase the new property either one year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property. You can also use the gains to invest in the construction of a property. However, the construction must be completed within 3 years from the date of sale.

In Budget 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the sale consideration to claim this exemption. This exemption can be taken back, if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase. If the entire sale proceeds are invested towards the new house, the entire capital gain will be exempt from taxes if you meet the above-said conditions.

However, if you invest a portion of the sale proceeds, the capital gains exemption will be in the proportion of the invested amount to the sale price LTCG exemption = Capital gains x Cost of new house / Net consideration.

Section 54EC: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Reinvesting in specific bonds
Exemption is available under Section 54EC when capital gains from sale of the first property are reinvested into specific bonds.

If you are not keen to reinvest your profit from the sale of your first property into another one, then you can invest them in bonds for up to Rs. 50 lakhs issued by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
The money invested can be redeemed after 5 years, but they cannot be sold before the lapse of 5 years from the date of sale.
The homeowner has six month’s time to invest the profit in these bonds. But to be able to claim this exemption, you will have to invest before the tax filing deadline.
Section 54B: Exemption on Capital Gains From Transfer of Land Used for Agricultural Purpose
When you make short-term or long-term capital gains from transfer of land situated in Urban area used for agricultural purposes – by an individual or the individual’s parents or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) – for 2 years before the sale, exemption is available under Section 54B. The exempted amount is the investment in a new asset or capital gain, whichever is lower. You must reinvest into a new agricultural land (in urban or rural area) within 2 years from the date of transfer. 

The new agricultural land, which is purchased to claim capital gains exemption, should not be sold within a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase. In case you are not able to purchase agricultural land before the date of furnishing of your income tax return, the amount of capital gains must be deposited before the date of filing of return in the deposit account in any branch (except rural branch) of a public sector bank or IDBI Bank according to the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

Exemption can be claimed for the amount which is deposited. If the amount which was deposited as per Capital Gains Account Scheme was not used for the purchase of agricultural land, it shall be treated as capital gains of the year in which the period of 2 years from the date of sale of land expires.

Our handpicked plans can help you build a portfolio that is best suited to your financial goals and risk profile.

Section 54D: Capital Gains on transfer of  land and building which is used for  industrial undertaking 
Conditions to be fulfilled :

There must be compulsory purchase of land and building which is used for an industrial undertaking.
The land and building should have been used by the assessee for purposes of the business of the industrial undertaking in the 2 years before the date of transfer.
The assessee must purchase any other land or building or construct any building (for shifting or re-establishing the existing undertaking or setting up a new industrial undertaking) within 3 years from the date of transfer.
If such investment is not made before the date of filing of return of income, then the capital gain has to be deposited under the CGAS.
Amount of exemption :

If the cost of a new asset is more than or equal to the sale consideration, then the entire capital gain will be exempted.
If the cost of a new asset is lesser than Capital gains, capital gains to the extent of the cost of a new asset is exempt. i.e. the cost of a new asset will be exempted.
When can you invest in Capital Gains Account Scheme?
Finding a suitable seller, arranging the requisite funds and getting the paperwork in place for a new property is one time-consuming process. Fortunately, the Income Tax Department agrees with these limitations. If capital gains have not been invested until the due date of filing of return (usually 31 July) of the financial year in which the property is sold, the gains can be deposited in a PSU bank or other banks as per the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

This deposit can then be claimed as an exemption from capital gains, and no tax has to be paid on it. However, if the money is not invested, the deposit shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the year in which the specified period lapses.

Saving Tax on Sale of Agricultural Land
In some cases, capital gains made from the sale of agricultural land may be entirely exempt from income tax or it may not be taxed under the head capital gains. See below:

a. Agricultural land in a rural area in India is not considered a capital asset and therefore any gains from its sale are not chargeable to tax. For details on what defines an agricultural land in a rural area, see above.

b. Do you hold agricultural land as stock-in-trade? If you are into buying and selling land regularly or in the course of your business, in such a case, any gains from its sale are taxable under the head Business and Profession.

c. Capital gains on compensation received for compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land are tax exempt under Section 10(37) of the Income Tax Act.

If your agricultural land wasn’t sold in any of the above cases, you can seek exemption under Section 54B.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is the benefit of indexation available for computing capital gains arising on sale of a short-term capital asset?


Capital gains is determined by reducing the purchase price from the sale price. However, for an asset that has been held for a long time, it would not be appropriate to determine gains by merely reducing purchase price from sale price without giving any effect to the inflation. Hence, the concept of indexing the purchase price has been brought in. This way, the indexed purchase price can be reduced from sale price to determine gains. So, indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.

Should an NRI pay taxes on gains made on the sale of property in India?


Property sold in India is generally subject to tax deduction. The person buying the property must deduct taxes at the rate applicable to the NRI’s income slab, if the property is a short-term asset. If the property is a long-term asset, 20% LTCG tax is charged. Further, it is important for the NRI to ensure that taxes are deducted on the gains made and not on the sale proceeds. A jurisdictional Assessing Officer can help to determine the gains on which taxes should be deducted by the purchaser.

Can I set off my short-term capital loss against any other head of income?

In the new tax regime, w.e.f 01-04-2024, in case of a resident Individual, the rebate will be applicable on total income chargeable to tax under subsection (1A) of section 115BAC as under:

Form 10-IEA is a declaration made by the return filers for choosing the ‘Opting Out of New Tax Regime’. An Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person with business or professional income must submit Form 10-IEA if they wish to pay income tax as per the old tax regime. On the other hand, taxpayers who do not have income from business or profession can simply tick the “Opting out of new regime” in the ITR form without the need to file Form 10-IEA. Simply put, only those who file ITR-3, ITR-4 or ITR-5 have to submit Form 10-IEA if they have business income (other than coop societies). Individuals and HUFs filing their returns in Forms ITR-1 or 2 are not required to submit Form 10-IEA.

 

 

I am filing ITR in new regime for AY 2024-25. Can I switch between old and new tax regime in the next years?
An Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person with business or professional income will not be eligible to choose between the two regimes every year. Once they opt out of new tax regime, they have only one chance for switching to new regime. Once they switch back to the new regime, they won’t be able to choose old regime anytime in future. An individual with non business income can switch between the new and old tax regimes every year. Within the same year, again it is emphasized that the choice of old tax regime can be made only before the due date of filing the return u/s 139(1) of I T Act.

 

 

I am having business income and have opted in and opted out from the new regime in the previous years. So, will I be in old regime for the AY 2024-25?
Please note that new tax regime is default regime for AY 2024-25. Any actions in any previous years with respect to choice of regimes will not be applicable from AY 2024-25. You are required to submit Form 10-IEA again in case you want to opt for the old regime.

 

 

I have business income, I have wrongly filed Form 10-IEA but want to file the return under new tax regime. As there is no option to withdraw Form 10-IEA in that case whether my return can be filed under new tax regime?
Once Form 10IEA is filed for AY 2024-25, then it cannot be revoked / withdrawn in same AY. If you wish to re-enter into new tax regime then you can file Form 10IEA for withdrawal option in the next assessment year. Again it is emphasised that that the choice of old tax regime can be made only before the due date of filing the return u/s 139(1) of IT Act.

 

 

I am filing ITR-5. I want to opt out of new tax regime? Whether Form 10-IFA or Form 10- IEA would be applicable to me?
Form 10-IEA is applicable to AOP’s (other than Co-operative society) or BOI or AJP, who are filing return of Income in ITR-5 for AY 2024-25.

Form 10-IFA is applicable to new manufacturing co-operative Societies resident in India filing ITR 5, if they wish to avail New Tax Regime under Section 115BAE for AY 2024-25.

How to calculate income tax payable under new tax regime
For those salaried individuals who are continuing with the new tax regime for the current financial year, 2024-25, should know how to calculate income tax payable. It is important to remember that income tax slabs have been tweaked in new tax regime. Hence, knowing the correct way to calculate is important.

Further, for FY 2024-25, deductions available under new tax regime for a salaried individual have also been tweaked. A salaried individual can claim - i) Standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income instead of Rs 50,000 earlier, and ii) Section 80CCD (2) deduction for employer's contribution to employee's NPS account. This deduction can be claimed for up to 14% of the basic salary of an employee instead of 10% earlier.

Here is an example of how to calculate income tax payable under the new tax regime.

Suppose an individual's gross total income is Rs 20 lakh in FY 2024-25. He/she is eligible for standard deduction of Rs 75,000 in the current financial year and employer has deposited Rs 2 lakh in his/her Tier-I NPS account. This makes him eligible to claim deduction under section 80CCD (2) of the Income-tax Act.
Particulars
Amount (In Rs)
Gross total income
20,00,000
Standard deduction from salary/pension
(75,000)
Deduction under section 80CCD (2)
(2,00,000)

Net taxable income
17,25,000

Hence, the net taxable income on which income tax payable is to be calculated will be Rs 17.25 lakh (Rs 20 lakh minus Rs 2.75 lakh).

Under the new income tax regime, income between 0 to Rs 3 lakh is exempted from tax. Hence, no tax will be payable on this income. After deducting income of Rs 3 lakh from Rs 17.25 lakh the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 14.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000. Thus, out of taxable income of Rs 14.25 lakh, Rs 4 lakh (Rs 7 lakh minus Rs 3 lakh) will be taxed at 5%. The tax payable here will be Rs 20,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 10.25 lakh (Rs 14.25 lakh minus Rs 4 lakh).

The next income tax slab is Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. Out of taxable income of Rs 10.25 lakh, the taxable income of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 10 lakh minus Rs 7 lakh) will be taxed at 10%. The tax payable here will be Rs 30,000. After this, the income left to be taxed will be Rs 7.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 10,00,001 and Rs 12,00,000. Out of the balance income of Rs 7.25 lakh, Rs 2 lakh will be taxed at 15%. The tax payable under this slab will be Rs 30,000. After this income left for chargeable under the tax will be Rs 5.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000. Here out of the taxable income of Rs 5.25 lakh, Rs 3 lakh (Rs 15 lakh minus Rs 12 lakh) will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable amount here will be Rs 60,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 2.25 lakh.

The final income tax slab is for incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The balance taxable income of Rs 2.25 lakh will be taxed at 30%. The tax payable here will be Rs 67,500.

The total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,07,500. In this tax amount, the cess at 4% will be added to this amount for final tax amount payable.

How to calculate income tax liability under old tax regime
The July budget 2024 has kept the income tax slabs under the old tax regime unchanged. If a salaried taxpayer opts for the old tax regime in the current financial year 2024-25, then one can claim various deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime (which is a default tax regime) does not allow claiming various deductions and exemptions except the specified two.

By claiming deductions such as Section 80C, Section 80D, HRA tax exemption etc. one can reduce their gross taxable income and thereby reducing income tax liability.

Remember, the income tax slabs under the old tax regime has different income tax slabs depending on the age of individual in a financial year.

Here is an example on how to calculate income tax payable under the old tax regime.

Suppose an individual aged below 60 years has a gross total income of Rs 17 lakh for the current financial year, i.e., FY 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). An individual has decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year. Further, he/she is eligible to claim following tax exemption and deductions - section 80C for up to Rs 1.5 lakh, section 80CCD(1b) for NPS investment of Rs 50,000, section 80D of Rs 25,000 for medical insurance premium paid and section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 on savings account interest earned.

Section 80D – medical insurance premium
(25,000)
Section 80TTA
(10,000)
Net taxable income
14,65,000

After deducting the deductions from the gross total income, one arrives at the net taxable income of Rs 14,65,000. The tax payable will be calculated on the net taxable income.

As per the income tax slab rates table, the first Rs 2.5 lakh from net taxable income will be exempted from tax. This is because there is no tax on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh as per current income tax slabs in the old tax regime. Post this, income left on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 12,15,000 (14,65,000-2,50,000). The second slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh which is taxed at Rs 5%. This means that out of Rs 12,15,000, then next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at 5%. The tax amount will be Rs 12,500.

Now the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 9,65,000. The third slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, taxed at 20%. This means that out Rs 9,65,000, Rs 5,00,000 will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable here will be Rs 1,00,000.

The balance income on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 4,65,000. The tax amount on this balance income (Rs 14,65,000 minus Rs 10,00,000) will be calculated on the basis of the last slab, i.e., above Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 30%. The tax payable amount comes out to be Rs 1,39,500.

Hence, the total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,52,000 (Rs 12,500 + 1,00,000+ 1,39,500).

Do note that cess and surcharge are also levied on the income tax payable. Cess is levied at the rate of 4% and surcharge is levied if the total income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From the example above, the cess amount is Rs 10,080. The surcharge will not be applicable as net taxable income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh. The final tax amount payable by individual is Rs 2,62,080.
How to know which income tax slab you fall in
Individuals, not having business incomes, are required to choose between the two tax regimes in every financial year. Furthermore, an individual needs to know the income tax slabs in which their income will fall. These two factors will help an individual to determine which income tax regime is more beneficial to them.

To know the income tax slabs and rates applicable to your income under any income tax regime, one must first know the taxable income on which tax has to be calculated. If an individual continues with old tax regime, then he/she is eligible to claim tax exemption (such as House Rent Allowance exemption, Leave Travel Allowance exemption, standard deduction) and deductions under sections 80C to 80U, as eligible for. After claiming and deducting the tax exemptions and deductions that an individual is eligible for, he/she arrives at the net taxable income on which income tax payable is calculated.

For example, your gross total income from all sources is Rs 12 lakh and you are eligible to claim deduction of Rs 2.10 lakh under sections 80C, 80TTA, 80CCD(1b). The taxable income on which you have to calculate tax will be Rs 9.9 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 2.10 lakh). Your income tax slab in the old tax regime will be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The tax rate is the 20%.

However, the income tax slabs and income tax rules under the new tax regime have been revised in the July budget 2024. From April 1, 2024, the new tax regime allows standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income and Section 80CCD (2) deduction up to 14% on basic salary for employer's contribution to the employee's Tier-I NPS account.

From the example above, after claiming deduction, the taxable income is, say, Rs 9.9 lakh (Gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh minus Rs 2.10 lakh). The net taxable income of Rs 9.9 lakh falls under the revised income tax slab of Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. This will be taxed at 10%.



Surcharge on income tax
The July budget 2024 has not made any changes in the surcharge rates applicable on the income tax amounts under the new and old tax regimes. If an individual's net taxable income exceeds a specified level, then a surcharge is levied. The surcharge is levied on the income tax payable amount before the levy of cess. According to income tax laws, a surcharge is applicable if an individual's taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From FY 2023-24, the government made changes in the surcharge rates under the new tax regime. The new surcharge rates have come into effect from April 1, 2023.

Surcharge rate from April 1, 2023 under new tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Up to Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore	25%

However, individuals opting for the old tax regime in current FY 2024-25 will continue to pay the surcharge rate they were paying in the previous financial years.

Surcharge rate under old tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Upto Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore but up to Rs 5 crore	25%
More than Rs 5 crore	37%

There are certain exceptions to the surcharge rates mentioned above. If an individual has earned income from capital gains (short term or long term) through the sale of equity shares and equity mutual funds or dividend income, the surcharge will not exceed 15%, irrespective of the income range.

While understanding the concept of surcharge, one must also know the term marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief kicks in when the amount of surcharge on income tax payable exceeds the increase in income over the specified limit.

Suppose an individual has a net taxable income of Rs 51 lakh. As the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, the surcharge will be applicable at the rate of 10%. The tax payable on Rs 51 lakh (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250.

Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where the concept of marginal relief kicks in.

To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is because no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500.

To ascertain the actual income tax payable with surcharge, compare the normal tax liability (before surcharge and cess) and tax liability after marginal tax relief (without cess). Normal tax liability is Rs 13,42,500 and tax liability after marginal tax relief is Rs 14,12,500. The surcharge that will be applicable is Rs 70,000 (Rs 14,12,500 - Rs 13,42,500).

The final tax payable amount will be Rs 13,42, 500 (Tax payable amount) + Rs 70,000 (Surcharge) + Rs 56,500 (Cess at 4% on Rs 14,12,500) = Rs 14,69,000.

Effective from April 1, 2020 (FY 2020-21), an individual has an option to continue with the old tax regime (claim deductions and tax exemptions) or opt for the new tax regime without any deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime when announced was optional in nature and was offering lower tax rate as compared to the old tax regime. However, from FY 2023-24, the new tax regime has become default option. If no tax regime is chosen by the individual, then income tax payable will be calculated using new tax regime now.

Here are latest income tax slabs and rates applicable for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021- 22 (AY 2022-23) and FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24)

How to file an income tax return after the due date?


The due date to file ITR is July 31st. If you miss filing your ITR within the deadline, you can file a belated return or updated return. However, a late filing fee and interest will be applicable. Penalty in terms of additional taxes is also applicable in case of updated return.

How to file an income tax return for previous years?


You can file the ITR of previous years using updated return (ITR U form). Nevertheless, there are certain restrictions on eligibility and the number of years for which ITR-U can be used. For comprehensive information, refer to this article.

How to check if ITR is filed?


Step 1: Log in to the e-filing portal with your user ID and password.
If your PAN is not linked with Aadhaar, a pop-up message will indicate its inoperability. Link PAN with Aadhaar by clicking "Link Now" or continue without linking.
Step 2: Go to e-File > Income Tax Returns > View Filed Returns.
Step 3: View all your filed returns on the page. Use "Filter" to sort returns based on criteria like Assessment Year or Filing Type. Click "View Details" and you will be able to see the status of your ITR in the form of a return's life cycle along with action items (e.g., pending e-Verification).
Note: If PAN is inoperative, refund issuance will be on hold until linked.

What will happen if I have missed the due date or made a mistake while filing my Income Tax Return?


I missed the deadline: You can file a belated return before 31st December of the AY, i.e. For FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), the filing date of it would be till 31st Dec 2024. (It is called a belated return, i.e., a late-filed return with the payment of late fees u/s 234F).

I made a Mistake: You can revise your already filed ITR before 31st December of the AY, i.e. For FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24), the filing date of it would be till 31st Dec 2023.

If you missed the 31st Dec 2023 deadline, file the Updated return (ITR U) within the additional time limit only if the specified conditions are met.

I have filed my return. When will I get a refund?


Usually, it takes 30-90 days to get your refund after filing your Income Tax Return. You can track the refund check status from here.

Is it necessary to attach documents while e-filing ITR?


No, documents are not required to be attached/ uploaded, but you are advised to keep them with you. Income tax authorities may ask them if any assessment notice is served to you in future.

What are the consequences of non e-verifying income tax return?


It is required to either e-verify the return or send it by making the signature physically to CPC, Income Tax Department, Bengaluru within 30 days of filing the return. Failing to do so will result in invalidation of return, which means the return will be considered as having never been filed.

If the return is verified after 30 days, the date of e-verification will be considered as the date of filing, and if such date falls after the due date, then

the late filing fees of Rs.5000/Rs.1000 will be levied.
The tax regime shall be switched to the default regime, and the return will be processed. (For FY 2023-24, if the new tax regime was opted out, then the return will be processed under the new tax regime (default regime) by disallowing the ineligible exemptions and deductions.

Tax Slabs for AY 2025-26***

However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime. The old tax regime refers to the system of income tax calculation and slabs that existed before the introduction of the new tax regime. In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions.
In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).
In case of eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession, new tax regime is default regime. If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA. However, option to switch to old tax regime and withdraw the option in any subsequent AY is available only once in lifetime for eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession.

However, to make the new tax regime more attractive, the tax rebate was increased to Rs 25,000 for New Tax regime only. This made zero tax payable for taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh in the new tax regime for FY 2023-24 (from April 1, 2023).

However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime. The old tax regime refers to the system of income tax calculation and slabs that existed before the introduction of the new tax regime. In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions.
In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).

If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA.

Note: NPS has a separate section 80CCD(1B) that allows an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit of section 80C.

ELSS (Equity-Linked Saving Scheme) Mutual Fund
Let us discuss further in detail the tax-saving investment options:-

The equity-linked Saving Scheme is a tax-saving investment option under Section 80C that has two features: First, the investment amount under the ELSS scheme is allowed for tax exemption up to the maximum limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. Second, the Equity-Linked Saving Scheme investment has a lock-in period of 3 years.

The annual return offered by the ELSS funds is approximately between 5%-18% (The interest rate offered by the ELSS funds is not fixed and depends on the market performance of the underlying equities). The returns received are not constant in an equity-linked saving scheme as they vary per the fund's market performance.

This tax-saving investment scheme offers liquidity and flexibility in investment and is best suited for those ready to take risks.

The returns received from ELSS are subject to long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) at 10% if the gain exceeds Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year. However, a top ELSS fund in one period need not be the best for the next period, too. The best ELSS fund should be selected for its performance across the bull and bear market phases.

Moreover, one can track one's investment in the ELSS online simply and hassle-free.

National Pension Scheme (NPS)
As per the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the National Pension Scheme is designed to help individuals save for retirement. National Pension Scheme (NPS) is for both government and private employees. Any age group from 18-70 years can participate in the NPS program.

NPS is a good tax-saving investment option, as fund management charges are pretty low. Fund management is done under four accounts in the NPS scheme: equity, corporate bonds, government securities, and alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in assets such as venture capital, private equity, real estate, etc. These accounts help investors manage their portfolios actively or passively.

There is a tax deduction of Rs. 1,50,000/- for self-contribution to NPS, which is covered under Section 80C. Under Section 80CCD(1B), an additional deduction of Rs. 50,000 is allowed against the contribution to NPS. Therefore, this scheme provides a tax benefit of up to Rs. 2 lakh.

Employer’s NPS Contribution is covered under section 80CCD(2) of the Income Tax Act.

Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)
Unit Linked Insurance Plan is the most versatile tax-saving investment option as it allows you to invest in debt, equity, or both, according to your requirement and risk appetite. Therefore, investing in insurance is beneficial in terms of both investment and saving.

Insurance provides financial security for the whole family and a tax-free lump sum amount on maturity. The premium paid towards purchasing a life insurance policy qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, the final amount received on maturity is tax-free as per Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act.

Public Provident Fund (PPF)
PPF is a very commonly heard term among taxpayers. PPF falls under the exempt tax status, hence the reason for its popularity. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office, but they can also be transferred from one branch to another or from post office to bank and vice versa.

The amount invested during the financial year for the PPF qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The interest and the maturity amount are exempt from tax under section 10 of the Income Tax Act. The PPF account lock-in tenure is 15 years.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is one of the essential tax-saving investment options. Launched under the government’s “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” campaign, SSY focuses on improving girl-child life. The scheme allows the taxpayer to deposit some amount in the account regularly and earn interest simultaneously. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana also qualifies for deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The minimum amount is Rs.250, and the scheme matures 21 years or till the girl child gets married, whichever is earlier after the account opening.

Interest accrues on the SSY Account, which gets compounded annually, is eligible for tax exemption under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

Maturity proceeds or any withdrawal amount is also exempt from tax under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

National Savings Certificate (NSC)
National Saving Certificate is a fixed-income investment scheme that is aimed at small- and middle-income investors. NSC is a good tax-saving investment option as the risk is low and is as secure as the provident fund. Moreover, the investment in NSC qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

The interest earned is also added back to the initial investment and is eligible for tax exemption.

The features of the NSC tax-saving investment option are as follows:

A guaranteed return of 6.8% annual interest.
A tax benefit of up to Rs. 1.5Lakh
Investment can be made as low as Rs. 1,000 (or multiples of Rs. 100)
The investor will receive the entire maturity value, which will be taxed to the taxpayer.
Senior Citizen Saving Scheme
As the name suggests, the Senior Citizen Saving scheme is available to senior citizens who are residents of India. This scheme offers one of the highest rates among the various saving schemes. Although this scheme's lock-in period is five years, the depositors can extend the maturity period by another three years. Moreover, the depositors can make investments with a minimum amount of Rs.1000 and multiples thereof.

The Senior Citizen Saving Scheme investment qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C. The interest on such deposits is taxable and liable for tax if the interest exceeds Rs. 50,000.

Bank FDs
Fixed deposits are considered one of the risk-free tax saving investment schemes. The bank decides the interest rate on a minimum lock-in period of five years. In the scenario of a joint account, the primary holder can avail of the benefit of tax deduction while calculating the taxable income. Additionally, senior citizens get the maximum benefits from a higher interest rate on investment. Premature withdrawal is not allowed in the tax-saver bank fixed deposits.

Investors can claim a maximum deduction of Rs. 1.5 Lakh by investing in a tax-saving FD A/c.

Interest earned from Saving Accounts Deposits under 80 TTA
All taxpayers can avail of a tax deduction on the interest generated from savings account deposits within limits. This interest can be from savings accounts in banks, post offices, or accounts in cooperative societies involved in the banking business. This tax-saving investment option is for ordinary taxpayers, not senior citizens.

The maximum deduction limit is Rs. 10,000 under this section, which includes the interest earned from all the savings accounts one has. Beyond this limit, any interest earned will be taxable.

Under Section 80TTB, the benefit of the least tax implication on interest income is provided for a senior citizen. Under this section, a deduction up to Rs. 50,000 or an amount from a particular income is allowed from the total gross income.

Interest paid toward the repayment of the Education Loan
Under Section 80E, students who take education loans to fulfill their education dreams are offered a tax exemption on the interest repayment. There is no cap on the deduction to be claimed. Tax deduction claims can be made from the start of the year when the payer starts paying the interest on the education loan and within the seven immediately subsequent financial years or until the interest is completely paid, whichever is earlier.

Premium paid toward the Health Insurance Policies or incurred medical expenses in case of senior citizens
The total taxable income towards the premium paid on Health insurance and expenses incurred towards healthcare is allowed for tax deductions under Section 80D. The limit to claim this deduction depends on the taxpayer’s family situation:-



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Eligibility                                                   | Exemption Limit                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Health insurance for self and family (spouse and children)    | Rs. 25,000                             |
| For self and family + parents                                 | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 25,000 = Rs. 50,000   |
| For self and family (below 60 years) + Parents above 60 years | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 75,000   |
| For self and family (with members above 60 years) +           | Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 |
| senior citizen parents                                        |                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interest Paid toward Home Loan
Under Section 24 (b), interest payments toward home loans can be claimed. The maximum limit that a taxpayer gets on the interest payment of a home loan is Rs. 2 lakhs if the house property is self-occupied.

Further, in those cases where the home loan taken for the property is not self-occupied but instead is rented, there is no limit on maximum tax deductions. A deduction can be taken on the whole interest amount.

Payouts on the maturity of the Life Insurance Plan
As per section 10(10D), all the incomes received from a life insurance plan upon maturity, surrender, or death of the policyholder are tax-free.

Exemption of House Rent paid (if mentioned in salary break-up)
If there is no HRA added to your salary break-up because you work in some small, medium-sized companies. In this case, you can claim deductions on the rent paid for furnished/unfurnished accommodation as per Section 80GG. The same rule applies to self-employed people, too. The conditions to claim the deductions are:-

Must not have received HRA during any part of the fiscal year
Should not be possessing any house in the city of occupation
Individuals should not own a house in the city of occupation in the name of spouse, minor child, or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) of which the person is a member.
Owning a house in any other city different from the occupation city is eligible for deductions, but it shouldn’t be self-occupied or left vacant.
The amount of deduction under this provision exempts up to the lowest value of the listed parameters:

The rent paid more than 10% of the total income
25% of the total income after adjustment
a maximum of ₹5,000 per month.
Hence, the maximum deduction allowed during the year is ₹60,000.

Deduction of House Rent paid (if not mentioned in salary break-up)
Under Section 10(13A) Income Tax Act offers tax benefits in the minimum value of the following:-

Actual annual rent allowance disbursed by the employer
50% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) if the house is situated in metro cities or 40% of the Basic Salary plus DA if the house is situated in other cities.
Actual rent paid for the house – 10% of basic pay plus DA.
In the above calculations, DA will be considered if it forms a part of retirement benefits.

Donations made to Charitable Institutions
Deductions can be claimed for the donations made to approved charitable institutions under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. The condition is that the donation should have been made by any mode other than cash, as cash donations exceeding Rs. 2,000 do not qualify as deductions.

Further, to claim this deduction, a taxpayer needs a stamped receipt from the institution they have made the donation, with details of the name of the trust, address, PAN Number of the Trust, the amount of donation, etc.

Donations to Scientific Research and Rural Development
Taxpayers can claim deductions under Section 80GGA for the donations made for scientific research and rural development. There is no cap, and 100% of the income spent is eligible for the deduction, provided the transaction is made via a bank account if the donation exceeds Rs. 10,000/-.

Donations to Political Parties
Under Section 80GGC, the entire income spent on the donation towards political parties is waived off from tax calculations, provided the transaction is made via a bank account. Also, the political party to which the donation is made must be registered under Section 29A of the Representation of People Act (RPA) of 1951.

Medical expenses for the disabled person
Under Section 80DD, individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) can claim deductions of the amount spent for the treatment and well-being of a disabled dependent family member. However, this claim is offered only to the legal family of such dependent individuals.

Based on the percentage of disability, if people have 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If people have disabilities, more than 80% can, they claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Flat Deduction for Disabled Person on the Basis of Severity of Disability
Under Section 80U, the disabled individual can claim tax deductions if a registered medical authority documents the disability with a minimum 40% impairment.

If the disabled individual has 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If individuals have disabilities of more than 80%, they can claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Individuals Diagnosed With Specific Diseases or Disability
Under Section 80DDB, individuals can claim exemptions on subsequent income spent on the treatment of dependent family members diagnosed with specific diseases. These critical illnesses include neurological disorders, AIDS, chronic renal disease, malignant cancers, and hematological ailments. For individuals below 60, a maximum of Rs. 40,000 is disbursed, and the same increases to Rs. 1 lakh for senior and super senior citizens.

Interest Earned on Deposits by Senior Citizens
Senior citizens take a heavy charge on their finances because of the expenditure on medical expenses. Relaxation from tax deductions helps senior citizens to simplify their lives. Under Section 80 TTB, senior citizens aged 60 years and above can claim Rs. 50,000 or a specified amount as a deduction from their gross total income for that fiscal year.

How to Plan your Tax Saving Investments for the Year?
Planning your tax-saving investments for the year requires strategic thinking to ensure you meet your financial goals while reducing your tax liability. Here's how to plan effectively:

Understand Your Tax Liability

Review your total taxable income and estimate the tax liability based on the applicable tax slab.
Identify areas where you can claim deductions or exemptions to reduce taxable income.
Choose the Right Investment Tools

Section 80C: Invest in options like PPF, ELSS, NSC, or Tax-saving FD, which offer up to ₹1.5 lakh in deductions.
National Pension Scheme (NPS): Contributions to NPS are eligible for additional deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) up to ₹50,000.
Health Insurance (Section 80D): Premiums paid for health insurance can give you deductions, which is beneficial for families and senior citizens.
Home Loan Repayment (Section 80C and 24B): Claim deductions on principal repayment and interest paid on home loans.
Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance

Select investments according to your risk appetite—ELSS funds for aggressive investors or PPF for a safer, long-term bet.
Consider mixing different investment types to balance growth and risk.
Plan for Long-Term Goals

Focus on long-term growth instruments such as NPS or PPF to not only save tax but also secure your retirement and long-term financial goals.
Avoid frequent withdrawal from tax-saving instruments to maximize growth.
Consider Tax-Free Income

Invest in tax-free instruments like the Public Provident Fund (PPF) or tax-free bonds that generate interest without adding to your tax burden.
Monitor and Adjust Your Portfolio

Regularly review your investments to make sure they align with your changing tax and financial needs.
Rebalance your portfolio annually, especially if tax-saving limits are reached or if tax laws change.
Make Investments Before the Deadline

Be mindful of the deadlines, typically before the end of the financial year (31st March), to claim deductions for the current year.

Home Loan Tax Benefit - How To Save Income Tax On Your Home Loan?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

5 min read


If you are acquiring a home by taking a loan, then you can claim deductions on interest portion that you repay as a part of EMI, in accordance with the regulations of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 

While obtaining a housing loan can be costly, it is also possible to benefit from several tax deductions that can help you save money on taxes each year. It is important to understand how to maximize these benefits.

Home Loan Tax Benefit
Impact of New Tax Regime on Home Loan Benefits
Home Loan benefits under the old tax regime remain the same as one can avail deductions without any restrictions, however, the under new tax regime benefits are curtailed, let’s know in detail about the same

Deduction under section 80C for the payment towards principal component of the home loan, stamp duty, registration charges and Section 80EE, Section 80EEA are not available
Deduction under section 24(b) for the payment towards the interest component of the home loan is not available for self-occupied property.
However, deduction under section 24b is available for let-out property. If net income from let out property results in loss, then such loss will be allowed to set off against profit from another house property but not allowed to set off against other heads of income like salary or other sources.
Deduction for Interest Paid on Housing Loan under Section 24
A loan must be taken for the purchase or construction of a house property to claim a tax deduction. If it is taken for the construction of a house, then construction must be completed within five years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken.

The interest portion of the home loan EMI for the year can be claimed as a deduction from your total income up to a maximum of Rs 2 lakh under Section 24. 

From the assessment year 2018-19 onwards, the maximum deduction for interest paid on self-occupied house property is Rs 2 lakh.

For let out property, there is no upper limit for claiming tax exemption on interest, which means that you can claim deduction on the entire interest paid on your home loan. 

In case the construction exceeds the stipulated time, i.e. 5 years, you can claim deductions on interest of home loan only up to Rs 30,000 for the financial year.

ITR Filing Last Date 2024
The last date to file Income Tax Return (ITR) for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) without a late fee is 31st July 2024.

Deduction on Interest Paid Towards Home Loan During the Pre-Construction Period
Say you bought an under-construction property and have not moved in yet but you are paying the EMIs. In this case, your eligibility to claim interest on the home loan as a deduction begins only upon completion of construction or immediately if you buy a fully constructed property. 

So, does this mean you would not enjoy any tax benefits on the interest paid during the period falling between the borrowing of loan and completion of construction? Yes, it will be available but with some conditions and in future years.

Let’s understand how. 

The Income Tax Act allows you to claim a deduction for such interest, which is also called pre-construction interest. You are allowed to deduct it in five equal instalments starting from the year the property is acquired or construction is completed, over and above the deduction you are otherwise eligible to claim from your house property income. However, the maximum eligibility remains capped at Rs 2 lakh.

For example, you availed a home loan in April 2021 for construction and paid an interest of Rs 10,000 a month. Construction of the house was completed in April 2023 after two years. Hence, you can start claiming the pre-construction interest of Rs 2.4 lakh (approx) paid by you only after the construction gets completed in five equal instalments starting from the year 2023-24. Maximum interest deduction under Section 24(b) is capped at Rs 2 lakh (including current year interest + pre-construction interest). So if you paid interest of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year 2023-24 then you can claim a total interest deduction of Rs. 1,68,000 (i.e., Rs. 1,20,000 as current year interest and Rs. 48,000 as 1/5th installment of pre-construction interest).

Further, if your home loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80EEA, you can claim an additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh over and above the limit of Rs. 2 lakhs u/s 24(b). We have discussed Section 80EEA later in this article.

Deduction on Principal Repayment under Section 80C
The principal paid on the home loan EMI for the year is allowed as a deduction under section 80C. The maximum amount that can be claimed under this section is up to Rs 1.5 lakh.

But to claim this deduction, the house property should not be sold within five years of possession. Otherwise, the deduction claimed earlier will be added back to your income in the year of sale.

Deduction for Stamp Duty and Registration Charges under Section 80C
Besides claiming the deduction for principal repayment, a deduction for stamp duty and registration charges can also be claimed under Section 80C but within the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. 

However, it can be claimed only in the year these expenses are incurred.

Additional Deduction under Section 80EE
Additional deduction under Section 80EE is allowed to the home buyers for a maximum of up to Rs 50,000. To claim this deduction, the following conditions should be met:

The amount of loan taken should be Rs 35 lakh or less, and the property’s value shall not exceed Rs 50 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2017.
And on the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first-time house owner.
Additional Deduction under Section 80EEA
To promote the housing sector, Budget 2019 has introduced an additional deduction under Section 80EEA for homebuyers for a maximum of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. 

To claim this deduction, below mentioned conditions should be met:

The stamp value of the property does not exceed Rs 45 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022 (extended from 31 March 2021)
On the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first time home buyer.
The individual should not be eligible to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA if claiming a deduction under Section 80EE.
Deduction for Joint Home Loan
If the loan is taken jointly, each loan holder can claim a deduction for home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh each and principal repayment under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh each in their tax returns.

To claim this deduction, they should also be co-owners of the property taken on loan. So, a loan taken jointly with your family member can help you claim a larger tax benefit.

Loss under the Head House Property
If you have not let-out any of your house property then there are high chances that you might incur a loss under the head house property, reason being the interest deduction that you might avail u/s 24(b). Further, even if you have rented out the property, you can incur a loss under the head house property because there is no limit on interest on home loan deductions so your interest can exceed your rental income.

If you have incurred a loss above Rs. 2 lakhs then you cannot set off such losses during the current year, but you are allowed to carry forward such losses for 8 years and claim the same against your income from house property in future years.

About NPS
NPS, or National Pension System, is a government-sponsored pension scheme available to both salaried and self-employed individuals. It offers dual benefit:

Tax savings during your working years
A regular income stream after retirement 
NPS is one of the most popular options for individuals seeking to create a retirement corpus and a regular monthly income. The money deposited in NPS is invested in various securities and investment avenues, including the equity market. It is widely regarded as one of the cheapest investment options with equity exposure. As the returns are directly related to the market performance, there is no guarantee of any particular amount. Still, over a period of time, returns from NPS have been among the highest in the market.

Two Types of NPS Accounts
There are two types of accounts in NPS, NPS Tier 1 and NPS Tier 2.

Tier 1 Account (Pension Account):This has a fixed lock-in period until the subscriber reaches the age of 60 years. Only partial withdrawal is allowed, with certain conditions. Contributions made towards Tier 1 are tax deductible and qualify for deductions under Section 80CCD(1) and Section 80CCD(1B). This means you can invest up to Rs. 2 lakhs in an NPS Tier 1 account and claim a deduction for the full amount, i.e. Rs. 1.50 lakh under Sec 80CCD(1) and Rs. 50,000/- under Section 80CCD(1B).
Tier 2 Account (Additional Account): This is a voluntary savings account that allows subscribers to make withdrawals as and when they like. Only the contributions made by a Central government employee to a Tier 2 account are eligible for tax deduction. To open a Tier 2 account, you must open a Tier 1 account first. The deposits made in the NPS Tier II accounts are eligible for an income tax deduction, under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, for government employees. On the other hand, there is no income tax deduction offered on NPS Tier II deposits for private-sector employees and the gains in the NPS Tier 2 are taxable at the respective slab rates.
Eligibility under Section 80CCD(1B)
An individual taxpayer is eligible to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(1B) by filing the income tax return under the old tax regime. 

However, there is an age restriction for opening an NPS account. The following individuals can open NPS:

Resident individuals between 18-70 years  
Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) aged between 18-70 years. However, if NRI’s citizenship changes after investing in NPS, the scheme will be terminated.

Things to Note while Claiming Deductions Under Section 80CCD(1B)
Here are some of the critical points about Section 80CCD(1B) that you should be aware of:

Individuals must file their taxes under the old tax regime, i.e., opting out of the applicability of sec 115BAC(1A).
The additional deduction of Rs. 50,000/- is available only for contributions made to NPS Tier 1 accounts
Tier 2 accounts are not eligible to claim the deduction under Section 80CCD(1B)
The deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) are available to salaried individuals as well as to self-employed individuals
You need to produce documentary evidence of the transaction related to the contribution to NPS
Partial withdrawals are allowed under NPS but are subject to specific terms and conditions
The total exemption limit under Section 80CCD(1B) is Rs. 50,000/- and is independent of exemptions under Section 80C. Thereby, you can claim a maximum deduction of  Rs. 2 lakhs
In case the assessee dies and the nominee decides to close the NPS account, then the amount received by the nominee is exempt from taxation
Documents Required to Claim Tax Benefit Under NPS

The following documents are required to be submitted while investing in NPS:

Bank account statement
PAN card
Aadhaar card
Taxation on NPS Withdrawal

If partial withdrawals are made from the account, then only 25% of the contribution made is exempt from taxation. If the assessee is an employee and decides to close the NPS account or opt out of NPS, then only 40% of the total amount is tax-exempt. The assessee can withdraw 60% of the entire amount upon reaching the age of 60 as tax-free income. The remaining 40% is also tax-free if it is used to purchase an annuity plan. 

Section 80CCD(1B) offers you an excellent opportunity to save a substantial amount on your taxation liabilities. This way, you can not only reduce your present tax liabilities but also work towards creating a substantial corpus for your retirement. Remember the points mentioned above, taking any action related to your NPS account regarding Section 80CCD(1B).

The purpose of the Public Provident Fund (PPF), which was first implemented in India in 1968, was to mobilise small contributions for investment and return. It can also be referred to as an investment vehicle that enables one to accumulate retirement funds while reducing yearly taxes. Anyone looking for a safe investment option to save taxes and earn guaranteed returns should open a PPF account.


How Important is PPF?
The PPF (Public Provident Fund) is considered an excellent investment option, especially for people uncomfortable with taking risks. While the returns may not be very high because they depend on the market, they offer stability. Additionally, investing in PPF can help diversify your portfolio and has tax benefits.


However, please note that to receive interest on your PPF investments, they must be made on or before the 5th of each month, as the interest is calculated on the lowest balance at the credit of account between the close of the fifth day and the end of the month. 

What is PPF Account?
PPF – Key Information
Interest Rate	7.1% per annum.
Minimum Investment Amount	Rs.500
Maximum Investment Amount	Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.
Tenure	15 years
Risk Profile	Offers guaranteed, risk-free returns
Tax Benefit	Up to Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C
Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a long-term investment option that offers an attractive rate of interest and returns on the amount invested. The interest earned and the returns are not taxable under Income Tax. One has to open a PPF account under this scheme and the amount deposited during a year will be claimed under section 80C deductions.

Features of PPF account
Below are the essential features of PPF

Tenure: The PPF has a minimum tenure of 15 years, which can be extended in blocks of 5 years as per your wish.
Investment limits: PPF allows a minimum investment of Rs 500 and a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh for each financial year. Investments can be made in a lump sum or in a maximum of 12 instalments.
Opening balance: The account can be opened with just Rs 100 a month. Annual investments above Rs 1.5 lakh will not earn interest and will not be eligible for tax savings.
Deposit frequency: Deposits into a PPF account have to be made at least once every year for 15 years.
Mode of deposit: The deposit into a PPF account can be made either by way of cash, cheque, demand draft (DD) or through an online fund transfer.
Nomination: A PPF account holder can designate a nominee for his account either at the time of opening the account or subsequently.
Joint accounts: A PPF account can be held only in the name of one individual. Opening an account in joint names is not allowed.
Risk factor: Since PPF is backed by the Indian government, it offers guaranteed, risk-free returns as well as complete capital protection. The element of risk involved in holding a PPF account is minimal. As the returns from PPF accounts are fixed, they are used as a diversification tool for the investor’s portfolio. 
Tax benefit: The PPF interest and maturity amount are tax-free under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Partial withdrawal: PPF amount can be withdrawn partially from the 5th financial year onwards.
What is PPF Interest Rate?
The PPF interest rate for 2024-25 is 7.1% p.a., which is compounded annually. 
However, to receive the PPF interest for the deposit month, it is very important that you deposit your PPF amount within 5th of that month.


The Finance Ministry sets the interest rate every year, which is paid on 31st March. The interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the 5th day and the last day of every month. Thus, if you invest in PPF after the 5th day of the month, it will not be considered for interest calculation, and the balance which is there on the 5th day will be taken into consideration.

In a nutshell, the PPF contribution made on the 5th of a month will earn interest for that month, while any PPF contribution made after the 5th of the month will not earn interest and result in a loss of interest for that month.

Further, use our PPF calculator to figure out the returns you can expect on investing a certain amount in a PPF account.

PPF vs Mutual Funds
The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a savings scheme provided by the government, which offers guaranteed returns. However, there are other investment options available, such as mutual funds, that also offer tax-saving advantages. Mutual funds are investment vehicles that distribute funds among different types of assets, like stocks and bonds. They gather money from multiple investors and make strategic investments in securities.


Mutual funds have the potential to provide higher returns and greater liquidity compared to PPF. They are classified into different categories based on the asset class, such as equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. It's worth noting that only Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) among mutual funds are eligible for tax savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

Mutual funds have a proven history of delivering returns that have surpassed the market, making them a widely chosen investment option. Each category of mutual funds has its investment objective and level of risk.

Which is a Better Option: PPF or FD?
Public Provident Funds (PPF) and Fixed Deposits (FDs) provide guaranteed returns in the form of interest. However, there are significant differences between the two:

Tenure: FDs offer flexible tenures ranging from as short as 7 days to as long as 10 years, giving investors the freedom to select a duration that aligns with their preferences. On the contrary, PPF has a fixed tenure of 15 years, providing a stable and long-term savings option.

Taxation: PPF provides tax-free returns, while FDs are subject to taxation, including TDS.

Interest Rates: FD interest rates are determined by individual banks and can vary from one bank to another. Moreover, senior citizens often receive preferential treatment with higher interest rates on their FDs than regular citizens.

Loan Options: PPF allows for loans against the account, but the maximum loan amount is limited to 25% of the balance after 1 year. On the other hand, FDs also provide the option to take loans, allowing borrowers to access up to 90% of their deposit amount. The interest rate on an FD loan is usually 1-2 percentage points higher than the prevailing FD interest rate.

Loan Types: FDs can serve as collateral for different types of loans, such as home loans, business loans, and education loans, among others. The bank and the specific loan type determine the loan interest rate.

Is LIC better than Public Provident Fund?
There is often confusion regarding the difference between investment and insurance. Insurance protects against risks, while investment aims to secure a stable financial future. Investors must prioritise their financial well-being by maintaining an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses, obtaining insurance coverage for protection against accidents or unforeseen events, and saving for a secure future.

Having insurance is crucial for investors who have dependents relying on their income. There are different types of insurance schemes available, including term insurance, ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans), and endowment plans. However, it is advisable to prioritise a term insurance policy for adequate coverage and consider investing in a PPF for long-term savings.

A cost-effective approach to combining insurance and investment security is by opting for a term insurance policy along with a PPF. Rather than comparing the superiority of LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) and PPF, the emphasis should be on selecting an appropriate term policy that complements the PPF and meets your insurance needs.

Insurance plans with investment options like ULIPs can indeed have high expense ratios and hidden charges. Therefore, it is generally recommended to separate investment and insurance needs. Choosing a term insurance policy alongside investing in a PPF is a prudent strategy that allows individuals to enjoy the benefits of insurance and investment without unnecessary complexities. This approach ensures a clear and straightforward approach to meet both objectives effectively.

Public Provident Fund (PPF) Limitations
PPF accounts do have certain drawbacks that should be considered:

1. Lock-in Period: PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years, which is longer than other tax-saving investments like Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) with a lock-in period of just three years. This extended lock-in period can pose challenges in case of emergencies or when there is a need for funds during the investment period. As discussed earlier, premature withdrawals are allowed in PPF, but there are restrictions and regulations on when and how much you can withdraw. Therefore, it's important to ensure that you can commit to investing in a PPF account for 15 years.

2. Moderate Interest Rate: The interest rate offered on PPF accounts is not very high, especially considering it is a long-term investment scheme. In contrast, ELSS has the potential to provide double-digit returns to investors.

3. No Joint Holding: PPF accounts cannot be held jointly, which can be a limitation if you intend to open a joint account with your spouse or other family members.

4. Investment Limit: The maximum amount that can be invested in a PPF account in a year is ₹1.5 lakh. However, there is no limit to the amount you can invest in other tax-saving instruments like ELSS funds, NPS, or FDs, although the maximum tax benefit that can be claimed remains the same at ₹1.5 lacks under Section 80C.

5. NRI Restrictions: While resident Indians can open new PPF accounts, this option is unavailable for NRIs. If you had a PPF account as a resident Indian and have become an NRI, you can continue making deposits into the account, but you cannot open new PPF accounts.


6. Annual Contribution Requirement: PPF mandates a minimum annual contribution to keep the account active. Failing to contribute the minimum amount can lead to the account becoming inactive, and reactivating it requires paying a penalty.

Considering these drawbacks, it is important to carefully evaluate your financial goals and circumstances before investing in a PPF account.

Conclusion 
If you prefer low-risk investments and value the security provided by government-backed instruments, PPF can be a suitable choice.

Login
Login to your Cleartax account and click on ‘Start Filing’.

ITR filing page of ClearTax
Create an Account or Login with ClearTax
Create a new account or simply click on Login if you are already a user of ClearTax.

Create an account or Login
Link Your PAN
Linking your PAN allows us to submit your return to the income tax department. 

If you are filing with us for the first time, you need to link your PAN by entering your PAN, Date of Birth, and the OTP received on your registered mobile number. You can verify the OTP using either your 'Aadhaar registered mobile number' or ‘IT Department registered mobile number.’

Link your Pan to e-file
Pre-fill Your Personal Information
If you have previously filed with Cleartax and your PAN is already linked, you will directly see the autofill screen. To pre-fill your information from the income tax department, you will need to complete another OTP verification. This OTP verification is to capture all your personal information and income details in your income tax return with maximum security of your data.


If you choose the 'IT Department' option, you will need to enter two OTPs, one sent to your mobile number and the other to your email.

Too many OTPs can seem a lot of effort, but it is totally worth it! Most of your information will be auto-filled. This saves you nearly 2 hours of your time that would have been spent manually entering and correcting details. Review the auto-filled information and modify if necessary.

Pre-fill information
Upload Form 16
Scroll down and find the 'Upload Form 16' option. By uploading your Form 16, your salary details will be automatically captured. If you do not have Form 16, you can still proceed directly to e-filing by clicking on “Continue to e-file”. You can also upload multiple Form-16's if you have switched jobs in the Financial Year.

Form 16 upload
Form 16 successful

ClearTax will then automatically calculate your income along with the exemptions, deductions, etc., based on the details provided in FORM-16. You will now be redirected to this page, where you can see all your personal details, such as your name, address, bank details, etc.

Note: If you prefer skipping the pre-fill option, you can manually enter the details.

Here, you will see 4 tabs: Personal Info, Income Sources, Tax Saving and Tax Summary. 

Personal Information
All your personal details like name, address and other details will appear here. You can expand each section and review these details. You also have the option to edit them, if required. 

Personal Information 
Income Sources
Go to the ‘Income Sources’ tab. 

Salary
If you didn't upload Form 16 earlier, you can upload it here and fill in the salary details.

Salary Income
Rental Income or House property
Enter the income from house property, considering whether you occupy the house or have rented it out.

Income from House property
Capital gain
If you have sold assets like stocks, mutual funds, Gold, bonds, shares received as a part of ESOP or RSU scheme, land or building, then the profit/loss from such transactions must be reported under capital gains section. 

Capital gains

1. Stocks and Mutual Funds: 
Simply choose your stockbroker from the available options and log in to your investment account. Your capital gains will be calculated within seconds. Cleartax can effortlessly import and process thousands of transactions from your profit and loss (P&L) report to accurately determine the capital gains amount.
If you have done any intraday transactions, they will be automatically categorized as business income rather than capital gains. 
We don’t have the login option for some brokers yet, but you can directly drag and drop or upload the P&L report here. 
If your broker is not listed, you can download the excel template, fill in the required details, and upload the completed template.
For mutual funds, you should upload the P&L report from CAMS or Karvy by selecting their respective icons. You can also navigate to the "Mutual Funds" tab, where you will find CAMS, KARVY, and a few other brokers. Upload the P&L report here and your capital gains will be computed. If you have non-demat mutual funds, please upload files from both Karvy and CAMS. However, if you don't have the excel files or if your broker's name is not listed, you can manually add the details as well.
2. US or foreign stocks
A separate section is dedicated to reporting capital gain details from foreign stocks. Similar to stocks, you can either import the details directly from your broker. Currently, we support transactions from brokers like INDMoney and Vested. Even if your broker isn't mentioned, you can use our excel template to report all the transactions at once.

3. ESOPs and RSUs
If you have sold the shares received under ESOP or RSU scheme, you can add the following details under this section:

type of shares (that is, whether they are listed or not listed), 
date of purchase and sale and 
value of purchase-sale and brokerage expenses. 
Your capital gains will be calculated. 

Likewise, you can add details for all the other assets like Bonds, gold, land and buildings

Professional, Freelancing and Business Income
So broadly, there are 5 sub-sections here:

The first section is 44ADA- this is for professionals. 
The income tax law has specified a few professions and made it clear that only these professionals can opt for 44ADA: 
- Legal
- Medical
- Engineering
- Architecture
- Accountancy
- Technical Consultancy
- Interior Decoration
- Film Artists like cameraman, producer, editor, actor, director, singer, etc are specified.

Under the “Nature of Business”, you will find approximately 40 codes. Select the appropriate code. If you're unsure of the code, simply search for your profession. Also, mention the trade name and description. If you have multiple professions, you can include them all. 
The next condition here is that your revenue should be less than equal to 75 lakhs. If your revenue is more than 75 lakhs, you will have to file taxes normally and you will not be eligible to opt for the presumptive scheme. Revenue is nothing but the total amount you have received for the service offered. It is also called gross receipts. Some folks call it consultation fees. For example, if you are  a practicing lawyer and your clients pay you 1 lakh rupees towards a case, that 1 lakh would be considered as Revenue. 
The other condition is that your expenses cannot be more than 50% i.e. by default it is assumed that your expenses or cost will not be more than 50% of your income. Say your revenue is 20 lakhs, then your expenses has to be up to 10 lakhs. You can show a lower amount say 7 lakhs, then you’ll pay taxes on 13 lakhs but you cannot show a higher amount than 10 lakhs. Let’s add 12 lakhs. If you enter an incorrect amount, you will see error prompts immediately which will guide you whether you are eligible for the presumptive scheme or not. So there is no scope of mistake here.

You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.
Now let’s look at the second section, i.e. 44AD
44AD is mainly for small businesses say a private tutor, web designer, freelance content writer, small business owners. Just like there were some conditions under 44ADA, there are some conditions for 44AD too. 
- The first condition is that your turnover, i.e. nothing but your sales, must be less than 3 crores and 
- the second condition is that your profit must be more than or equal to 8% of your turnover. So if your revenue is say 1 crore, then your profit should be atleast 8 lakhs and you will have to pay taxes on this profit.
But if you have received the money through digital means, then you can pay taxes on only 6% profit instead of 8%. Even if you have received them through Phonepe or GooglePay, that would be considered as digital means. Here again, you will have to select the nature of business, trade name etc There are nearly 200 codes you can choose from.
Add the sales amount you’ve received through digital and non-digital modes separately here. The profit for digital transactions should be atleast 6% and for non-digital it should be atleast 8%. Now you can fill up the assets and liabilities details and proceed. 
There will be some freelancers who would be working independently and running unrelated small businesses too. So they can declare income under both 44AD and 44ADA, as long as the conditions are met.
If your revenue and expense conditions are not met, then you can fill in all the details under the third section. We will automatically select the correct ITR form for you, i.e. ITR-3.
You can add all your other business income here and fill up the Balance sheet and P&L
You have to fill all the Financial particulars if you have the presumptive income. You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why is income tax return filing important?

The income tax department has mandated to file the return to individuals only in case their income is above the basic exemption limit or if they meet specific criteria like expenditure on foreign travel is more than Rs 2 lakh and electricity consumption of Rs 1 lakh or more, deposits of an amount/aggregate of an amount above Rs 1 crore in one or more current accounts, and other conditions that the government will notify.

Later, the government provided additional conditions via a notification dated 21st April 2022. It has notified below conditions where the taxpayer is required to file ITR: 

Total business turnover/sales/gross receipts during the FY exceeds Rs 60 lakh.
Total gross receipts of the profession exceed Rs 10 lakh during the FY.
The aggregate of TDS and TCS during the FY is Rs 25000 or more (for senior citizens, there is an increased limit of Rs 50,000).
Total savings bank account deposits are Rs 50 lakh or more during the FY.
Other scenarios where it is mandatory to file ITR includes:

In the case of a resident whose asset is located outside India or has signing authority for an account based outside India. It is always good to file your ITR even if you are not eligible due to the benefits.

Filing of ITR creates a valid proof of income.
ITR is required for applying for any loan in the future.
Banks require ITR even for applying for credit cards.
ITR is required for VISA applications, etc.
Hence it is advisable to file ITR even if your income is below the basic exemption limit.
What is income tax?

Income tax is a direct tax on your income. It means a portion of your income is paid to the government. The government charges this amount for expenditures related to health, education, providing subsidies to agriculture, infrastructure etc. It is paid by an individual/HUF/any taxpayer depending on income levels or gains in a financial year. A company has to pay income tax irrespective of the level of income. The government passes laws prescribing the rate of taxation on your income from time to time.

How to pay income tax online?

You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return. If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf. If you are liable to pay advance tax, you have to pay 90% of it before the 31st of March every financial year. You can file your ITR once the financial year ends.
The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date. It’s worthwhile noting that you attract a late filing fee of Rs 5,000 on failing to file ITR within the due date of the assessment year.

What is Advance Tax?


For salaried individuals, advance tax is mostly taken care of through TDS by employers. But other forms of income such as interest on savings bank accounts, fixed deposits, rental income, bonds, or capital gains increase the tax liability. One's tax liability needs to be estimated beforehand. If tax amounts to more than Rs.10,000/- per year, taxpayers need to pay advance tax in quarterly instalments (June, September, December and March).

Will I get a refund if I have paid excess tax?


Yes, any excess tax paid by you can be claimed as refund by filing your Income Tax Return. After your return is processed, ITD checks and accordingly accepts your refund claim, and then the amount is credited to your bank account. You will also get a message on your email ID registered on the e-Filing portal.





How to Calculate Income Tax from Income Tax Slabs?
Illustration 1: Rohit has a total taxable income of Rs 8,00,000. This income has been calculated by including income from all sources, such as salary, rental income, and interest income. Deductions under Section 80 have also been reduced. Rohit wants to know his tax dues as per the old regime for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-2025).

Note:

Please note that Rohit is an individual taxpayer assessee having an income tax exemption of Rs 2,50,000. For other taxpayer assessees, i.e. senior citizens and super senior citizens, the Income-tax limit for availing the exemption would be Rs 3,00,000 & Rs 5,00,000, respectively.

Individuals with net taxable income less than or equal to Rs 5 lakh will be eligible for tax rebate u/s 87A under the old tax regime, i.e. tax liability will be NIL.

Important Points to note if you select the new tax regime:
Please note that the tax rates in the New tax regime are the same for all categories of Individuals, i.e. Individuals, Senior citizens, and Super senior citizens. 
Individuals with net taxable income less than or equal to Rs 7 lakh will be eligible for tax rebate u/s 87A, i.e. tax liability will be NIL under the new regime.
The tax slabs under the new tax regime across different years is shown below.

What is Surcharge?
In case the income exceeds a certain threshold, the additional taxes are to be paid over and above existing tax rates. This is an additional tax on the High Income Earners.

Surcharge rates are as below:

10% of Income tax if total income > Rs.50 lakh and < Rs.1 crore,

15% of Income tax if total income > Rs.1 crore and < Rs.2 crore,

25% of Income tax if total income > Rs.2 crore and < Rs.5 crore,

37% of Income tax if total income > Rs.5 crore                  
*In Budget 2023, the highest surcharge rate of 37% has been reduced to 25% under the new tax regime. (applicable from 1st April 2023)

Surcharge rates of 25% or 37% will not apply to the income from dividends and capital gains taxable under sections 111A (Short Term Capital Gain on Shares), 112A (Long Term Capital Gain on Shares), and 115AD (Tax on the income of Foreign Institutional Investors). Therefore, the highest surcharge rate on the tax payable for such incomes will be 15%.
The surcharge rate for an Association of Persons (AOP) consisting entirely of companies will also be limited to 15%.

Here's a detailed list of exemptions and deductions available under the Old vs New Regime.

Old Tax Regime Vs New Tax Regime - Which is Better?
The new tax regime can largely benefit middle-class taxpayers who have a taxable income of up to Rs 15 lakh. The old regime is a better option for high-income earners.

The new income tax regime is beneficial for people who make low investments. As the new regime offers six lower-income tax slabs, anyone paying taxes without claiming tax deductions can benefit from paying a lower rate of tax under the new tax regime. For instance, the assessee having total income before deduction up to Rs 12 lakh will have higher tax liability under the old system if they have investments less than Rs. 3,12,500. Therefore, if you invest less in tax-saving schemes, go for the new regime.

That being said, if you already have in place a financial plan for wealth creation by making investments in tax-saving instruments; medical claims and life insurance; making payments of children’s tuition fees; payment of EMIs on education loan; buying a house with a home loan; and so on, the old regime helps you with higher tax deductions and lower tax outgo.

In light of the above and considering the new income tax regime, if taxpayers want to opt for the concessional tax rates, they may evaluate both regimes. Hence, it is advisable to do a comparative evaluation and analysis under both regimes and then choose the most beneficial one, as it may vary from person to person. Read a detailed breakdown on this topic here.

ITR stands for Income Tax Return. The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) releases all the ITR forms and specifies the procedures to be followed. This article provides an in-depth understanding of the definition of ITR and the types of ITR forms.

What is ITR?
Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form in which the taxpayers file information about their income earned and tax applicable, to the income tax department.

The department has notified 7 forms i.e. ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, ITR-4, ITR-5, ITR-6 & ITR-7 to date. Every taxpayer should file his ITR on or before the specified due date. The applicability of ITR forms varies depending on the sources of income of the taxpayer, the amount of the income earned and the category of the taxpayer like individuals, HUF, company, etc.

Which ITR should I file?
Why Should You File ITR?
If you want to claim an income tax refund from the department.
If you have earned from or have invested in foreign assets during the FY.
If you wish to apply for a visa or a loan
If the taxpayer is a company or a firm, irrespective of profit or loss.
If you have a loss from business/profession or under capital gains head, you will not be allowed to carry them forward to the next years unless you file the return before the due date.
When is it Mandatory to File Income Tax Returns (ITR) in India?
If your gross total income is more than the basic exemption limit-
Basic Exemption Limit under the old tax regime is as follows -

Age Group	Basic Exemption Limit
For individuals below 60 years	Rs 2.5 lakh
For individuals above 60 years but below 80 years	Rs 3.0 lakh
For individuals above 80 years	Rs 5.0 lakh
Irrespective of age, basic exemption limit under the new tax regime is Rs.3 Lakh.

If your income is below the basic exemption limit, you will still be required to file your tax return if you meet any of these conditions:
Deposited more than Rs 1 crore in 'current' bank account: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have deposited a total of Rs. 1 crore or more in one or more current accounts with a bank. However, no such requirement has been specified for deposits made in the post office current account; or
Deposited more than Rs 50 lakh in 'savings' bank account: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have deposited a total amount of Rs 50 lakh or more in one or more of your savings bank accounts.
Spent more than Rs 2 lakh on foreign travel: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have incurred a total expenditure of more than Rs 2 lakh on foreign travel whether for yourself or any other person; or
Electricity expenditure is more than Rs 1 lakh: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have incurred more than Rs.1 lakh towards electricity consumption during the previous year; or
TDS or TCS is more than Rs 25,000: If the tax deducted at source (TDS)/ tax collected at source (TCS) exceeds Rs 25,000 in the previous year. In the case of a senior citizen (above 60 years), this limit is Rs 50,000.
Business turnover is more than Rs 60 lakh: In case you are a businessman and your total sales, turnover, or gross receipt is more than Rs 60 lakh during the previous year, then you have to mandatorily file a tax return
Professional income is more than Rs 10 lakh: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you are engaged in a profession and your gross receipts are more than Rs 10 lakh during the previous year.

The government introduced various incentives in the recent times to encourage the adoption of the new regime. 

These changes show that the government intends to have taxpayers transition to the new regime and eventually phase out the old one. Though the new regime is now the default tax regime, the old tax regime will continue to exist.

Budget 2025 Update
The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how!

The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows:

Current Tax Rates under New Tax Regime
New Tax Regime
A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D , and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in the Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes, which remain the same even for FY 2024-2025 since no changes were made in the Interim Budget 2024, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime. They are:

Higher Tax Rebate Limit: Full tax rebate on an income up to ₹7 lakhs is allowed. Whereas this threshold is ₹5 lakhs under the old tax regime. This means that taxpayers with an income of up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay any tax at all under the new tax regime! 
Streamlined Tax Slabs: The tax exemption limit is up-to ₹3 lakhs, and the new tax slabs are:

Salary income: The standard deduction of ₹50,000, which was only available under the old regime, has now been extended to the new tax regime as well. This amount has been increased to ₹75,000 for the new regime only with effect from FY 2024-25.
Family pension: Those receiving a family pension can claim a deduction of ₹15,000 or 1/3rd of the pension, whichever is lower. This amount has been increased to ₹25,000 for the new regime with effect from FY 2024-25.
Reduced Surcharge for High Net Worth Individuals: The surcharge rate on income over ₹5 crores has been reduced from 37% to 25%. This move will bring down their effective tax rate from 42.74% to 39%. 
Higher Leave Encashment Exemption: The exemption limit for non-government employees has been raised from ₹3 lakhs to ₹25 lakhs, an 8-fold increase.
Default Regime: Starting from FY 2023-24, the new income tax regime will be set as the default option. If you want to continue using the old regime, you must submit the income tax return along with Form 10-IEA before the due date. You will have the option to switch between the two regimes annually to check the tax benefits.
Old Tax Regime
The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime.

Difference Between Old Vs New Tax Regime: Which is Better for FY 2024-25?
The decision to switch to the new or remain in the old tax regime or which regime is better for you shall be based on the tax savings deductions and exemptions you are eligible for in the old tax regime. To make it easier, we have calculated a breakeven point for various income levels (refer to the table below) for a salaried individual below 60 years of age. This can be used to determine which regime to choose.

The Breakeven Threshold for Deciding Between New vs Old Tax Regimes for FY 2023-24
The Breakeven point is the amount at which there will be no difference in tax liability between the two tax regimes. 

If your total eligible deductions and exemptions in the old tax regime are higher than the breakeven threshold for your income level, it is advisable to stay in the old regime. On the other hand, if the breakeven threshold is higher, then moving to the new tax regime is more beneficial.

How to Choose Between Old and New Tax Regimes?
When deciding between the two tax regimes, it is important to take into account the tax exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime. After deducting all eligible exemptions and deductions, the net taxable income can be determined. By calculating the tax liability based on this net taxable income under the old tax regime, it becomes possible to compare it with the tax liability under the new tax regime.

Choosing the regime with the lower tax liability is the logical approach, and it is essential to inform the employer about this choice so that the appropriate Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) can be deducted from the salary.

If you have a loss from house property, capital gains, or business & profession, you need to consider them as well while making informed decisions on the selection of regime. Along with the current year's losses, even the previous year's losses eligible to set off will get lapsed as well. Ineligibility to carry forward such losses may impact your future income determination and taxes thereon.

Conclusion
Many individuals often find themselves questioning the disparities between the old and new tax regimes. The new income tax regime is designed to accommodate those who have more personal commitments such as repayment of personal/vehicle loans, medical treatment of parents or dependents, or wish to avoid the burden of extensive tax preparation or have minimal tax deductions due to their ineligibility for section 10 exemptions, standard deductions, tax on employment, employer contribution to pension scheme etc., Conversely, the old tax regime can yield more tax savings for senior citizens, who derive a substantial portion of their income from interest, can benefit from Section 80TTB, which allows them to claim Rs.50,000 as interest income deduction and feel more secure under the old tax regime.

Both the old and new tax regimes possess advantages and disadvantages. The previous tax structure encourages taxpayers to cultivate a habit of saving, while the new tax structure favours employees with lower earnings and investments, resulting in fewer deductions and exemptions. The new tax system is considered safer and simpler, involving fewer records and reducing the potential for tax evasion fraud. However, due to the unique nature of individual deductions and exemptions, a thorough comparison of the two regimes is necessary to determine the best fit for each person.

Interest
If you submit your return after the deadline, you will be liable to pay interest at a rate of 1% per month or part month on the unpaid tax amount as per Section 234A.

Late fee
In case of late filing, Section 234F imposes a late fee of Rs.5,000, which shall be reduced to Rs.1,000 if your total income is below Rs.5 lakh.

Loss Adjustment
In case you have incurred losses from sources like the stock market, mutual funds, properties, or any of your businesses, you have the option to carry them forward and offset them against your income in the subsequent year. This provision substantially reduces your tax liability in future years. However, you will not be allowed to carry forward these losses if you miss filing your ITR before the deadline.

What if ITR Filing is Missed?
Belated Return
If you miss the ITR filing due date, you can file a return after the due date, called a belated return. However, you will still have to pay the late fee and interest charges, and you will not be allowed to carry forward any losses for future adjustments. The last date for filing a belated return is 31st December of the assessment year (unless extended by the government). 

Updated Return
Still, if you miss the 31st December deadline due to unavoidable reasons still you can file the updated (ITR U) return subject to the conditions specified therein. Click here to know more.

What are Financial Year (FY) and Assessment Year (AY)?
The return you will file in the upcoming year is for the income you earned in FY 2024-25, i.e. for the income earned between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025. The assessment year is the review year for FY 2024-2025, where you file your returns and declare your returns by declaring all the incomes, exemptions, deductions, losses etc., already made or incurred during the year for tax assessment. For the income earned during the FY (here FY 2024-25), the assessment year would be the immediately next year, i.e. 1st April 2025 to 31st March 2026. Hence, the assessment year would be AY 2025-26.

An Income Tax Refund is issued by the Income Tax Department if a taxpayer has paid more income tax than was due for the financial year. Individuals/Businesses pay income tax through TDS deducted, advance tax on the basis of anticipated liability, or self-assessment tax which might exceed the actual tax liability. In some cases, an income tax refund can also arise in case the tax liability is reduced by claiming deductions, exemptions, set off of losses, or tax credits while filing the income tax return.

Post-filing, the Income Tax Authorities assess the taxpayer's tax liability. In case the tax liability assessed exceeds the amount paid, the excess tax paid is refunded to the taxpayer along with interest at 0.5% per month or part of the month (i.e. 6% per annum) until the date of refund.

In this blog, you will gain an understanding of the following:

How to Calculate the Income Tax Refund with Example?
If you paid more taxes than you were required to pay, you can claim the additional amount as an income tax refund.

Income Tax Refund = Total Taxes paid – Total tax liability 

If the taxes paid (either by way of Advance Tax or TDS or TCS or Self-Assessment Tax) are more than the actual tax amount due, then the excess tax paid can be claimed as a refund. The income tax department will recompute the taxes and validate the refund claim before initiating the refund.

For example: Assume Mr. Gupta paid 3 lakh as an advance tax during the financial year. At the end of the financial year, he learns his tax liability is only 2 lakh. He can request a refund by filing an income tax return (ITR). If the assessing officer approves his request, the excess tax amount of 1 lakh will be credited to Mr Gupta's pre-validated bank account.

3 lakh Advance Tax - 2 lakh Tax liability = 1 lakh Tax refund for Mr. Gupta 

The excess amount will be refunded along with interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of the month. If the refund is received in September, then interest of Rs. 3,000 (1,00,000*0.5%*6) will also be credited to the bank account.

How to Claim an Income Tax Refund?

To get your income tax refund or TDS refund, all you need to do is file your Income Tax Return and declare your income, deduction and tax paid details to the Income Tax Department. Once the ITR is processed successfully and if there is any excess tax, it will be issued in your prevalidated bank account. Follow the process and file your ITR via Cleartax.

What is the Time Duration for a Tax Refund?
The time taken to receive the income tax refund entirely depends on the Income Tax Department’s internal process. Generally, it takes around 7 to 120 days, with an average time of 90 days after you have e-verified your return. The Income Tax Department implemented a new refund processing system to enable faster refund processing with an expected turnaround of a few days instead of a few months.        
Consistent with this objective, the average ITR processing duration has been reduced to 10 days for returns submitted in the AY 2023-24, as opposed to 82 days for returns submitted in the AY 2019-20 and 16 days for returns submitted in AY 2022-23.

The Income Tax Department will send the refund amount through electronic mode (direct credit to the account) or through a ‘Refund Cheque’. You must enter the correct bank account number and IFSC code with complete address details, including the PIN code, at the time of filing your return to receive refunds. Refunds sent through cheques are dispatched to the address mentioned in the ITR through speed post.

What is the Interest on Income Tax Refund?

When the refund amount is more than 10% of the total tax payable for that particular year, you will receive a simple interest on the tax refund. Interest is computed at 6% per annum (0.5% per month or part of the month) on the refund amount. Here's how the interest on refund is computed:

Calculate interest on refund @0.5% per month

How to Claim Refund for Missed ITR Filing on Due Date?

Investment in a immovable property, predominantly house is one of the most sought-after investments primarily because you get to own a house. While others may invest with the intention of earning a profit upon selling the property in the future. It is important to note that a house property is regarded as a capital asset for income tax purposes. Consequently, any gain or loss incurred from the sale of an immovable property may be subject to tax under the 'Capital Gains' head. Similarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investments. We will delve into the chapter on ‘Capital gains’ in detail here.

What is Capital Gains Tax in India?
Any profit or gain that arises from the sale of a ‘capital asset’ is known as ‘income from capital gains’. Such capital gains are taxable in the year in which the transfer of the capital asset takes place. This is called capital gains tax. There are two types of Capital Gains: short-term capital gains(STCG) and long-term capital gains(LTCG).

Defining Capital Assets
Land, building, house property, vehicles, patents, trademarks, leasehold rights, machinery, and jewellery are a few examples of capital assets. This includes having rights in or in relation to an Indian company. It also includes the rights of management or control or any other legal right.

 The following do not come under the category of capital asset:

a. Any stock, consumables or raw material, held for the purpose of business or profession

b. Personal goods such as clothes and furniture held for personal use

c. Agricultural land in rural(*) India

d. 6½% gold bonds (1977) or 7% gold bonds (1980) or National Defence gold bonds (1980) issued by the central government

e. Special bearer bonds (1991)

f. Gold deposit bond issued under the gold deposit scheme (1999) or deposit certificates issued under the Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 and Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2019 notified by the Central Government.

*Definition of rural area (effective from AY 2014-15) – Any area which is outside the jurisdiction of a municipality or cantonment board, having a population of 10,000 or more is considered a rural area. Also, it should not fall within a distance given below

 	
Shortest aerial distance from the local limits of a municipality or cantonment board

2

> 2 kms but < 6 kms

> 1,00,000

3

> 6 kms but < 8 kms

> 10,00,000

 


Types of Capital Assets?
1. STCA ( Short-term capital asset ) An asset held for a period of 24 months or less is a short-term capital asset. So, if you sell the asset within a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a short-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the holding period is reduced to 24 months and 12 months. 

Some assets are considered short-term capital assets when these are held for 12 months or less. This rule is applicable if the date of transfer is after 10th July 2014 (irrespective of what the date of purchase is). These assets are:

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
2. LTCA ( Long-term capital asset ): An asset held for more than 24 months is a long-term capital asset. They will be classified as a long-term capital asset if held for more than 24 months as earlier. So, if you sell the asset after a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a long-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the applicable holding period is 12 months. 

Capital assets such as land, building and house property shall be considered as long-term capital asset if the owner holds it for a period of 24 months or more (from FY 2017-18).

Whereas, below-listed assets if held for a period of more than 12 months, shall be considered as long-term capital asset.

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
Note: Capital gains from the sale of units of a specified mutual fund acquired on or after April 1, 2023, and market-linked debentures will always be treated as short-term capital gains, regardless of how long they have been held.

Calculating Capital Gains
Capital gains are calculated differently for assets held for a longer period and for those held over a shorter period.

Terms You Need to Know:
Full value consideration: The consideration received or to be received by the seller as a result of transfer of his capital assets. Capital gains are chargeable to tax in the year of transfer, even if no consideration has been received.

Cost of acquisition: The value for which the capital asset was acquired by the seller.   
Cost of improvement: Expenses of a capital nature incurred in making any additions or alterations to the capital asset by the seller.

Note:

In certain cases where the capital asset becomes the property of the taxpayer otherwise than by an outright purchase by the taxpayer, the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement incurred by the previous owner would also be included.
Improvements made before April 1, 2001, is never taken into consideration.
How to Calculate Short-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Cost of acquisition
Cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54B/54D

Step 4: This amount is a short-term capital gain to be taxed

Short-term capital gain =	Full value consideration   
Less: Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer( for e.g. brokerage on sale)   
Less: Cost of acquisition   
Less: Cost of improvement
How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Indexed cost of acquisition
Indexed cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54, 54D, 54EC, 54F, and 54B 

Long-term capital gain=	Full value consideration   
Less : Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer   
Less: Indexed cost of acquisition   
Less: Indexed cost of improvement   
Less: Expenses that can be deducted from full value for consideration*
(*Expenses from sale proceeds from a capital asset, that wholly and directly relate to the sale or transfer of the capital asset are allowed to be deducted. These are the expenses which are necessary for the transfer to take place.)

Exception: 

Long-term capital gains on the sale of equity shares/ units of equity oriented fund, realised after 31st March 2018, will remain exempt up to Rs. 1.25 lakh per annum.
If the transfer happened on or before 23/07/2024, tax at @ 10% will be levied only on LTCG on shares/units of equity oriented fund exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh in one financial year without the benefit of indexation.
If the transfer happened after 23/07/2024, tax rate is 12.5%. Exemption of Rs. 1.25 Lakh available.
Deductible Expenses
A. Sale of house property: These expenses are deductible from the total sale price:

Brokerage or commission paid for securing a purchaser
Cost of stamp papers
Travelling expenses in connection with the transfer – these may be incurred after the transfer has been affected
Where property has been inherited, expenditure incurred with respect to procedures associated with the will and inheritance, obtaining succession certificate, costs of the executor, may also be allowed in some cases
B. Sale of shares: You may be allowed to deduct these expenses:

Broker’s commission related to the shares sold
STT or securities transaction tax is not allowed as a deductible expense
C. Where jewellery is sold: In case of sale of broker’s jewellery and where a broker’s services were involved in securing a buyer, the cost of these services can be deducted.

Note: The expenses deducted from the sale price of assets for calculating capital gains are not allowed as a deduction under any other head of income, and you can claim them only once.

Indexed Cost of Acquisition/Improvement
The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.   
Refer to this page for the complete list of CII.  

The indexed cost of acquisition is calculated as:

Indexed cost of   
acquisition =	(Cost of acquisition X   
CII of the year in which the asset is transferred ) /   
CII of the year in which the asset was first held by the seller or FY 2001-02, whichever is later   
 
The cost of acquisition of the assets acquired before 1st April 2001 should be actual cost or FMV as on 1st April 2001, as per taxpayer’s option.

The indexed cost of improvement is calculated as:

Indexed cost of improvement =	Cost of improvement x CII (year of asset transfer) / CII (year of asset improvement)
Note: Improvements made before 1st April 2001, should not be considered.

Note: The indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

Exemption on Capital Gains
Example: Manya bought a house in July 2004 for Rs.50 lakh, and the full value of consideration received in FY 2016-17 is Rs.1.8 crore.   
Capital asset type: Since this property has been held for over 2 years, this would be a long-term capital asset.

Cost of acquisition: The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken. Using the indexed cost of acquisition formula, the adjusted cost of the house is Rs 1.17 crore. (Refer CII here for the calculations)

Capital gain: Hence, the net capital gain is Rs 63, 00,000.

Tax: Long-term capital gains on sale of house property are taxed at 20%. For a net capital gain of Rs 63, 00,000, the total tax outgo will be Rs.12,97,800.

This is a significant amount of money to be paid out in taxes. This can be lowered by taking benefit of exemptions provided by the Income Tax Act on capital gains when profit from the sale is reinvested into buying another asset.

Section 54: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Purchase of Another House Property
Budget 2019 announcement!  

Capital gains exemption under Section 54: Taxpayers can get an exemption from long-term capital gain from the sale of house property by investing in up to two house properties against the earlier provision of one house property with same conditions. However, the capital gain on the sale of house property must not exceed Rs 2 crores.

The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).

The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on sale.

Conditions for availing this benefit:

The new property can be purchased either 1 year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property.
The gains can also be invested in the construction of a property, but construction must be completed within three years from the date of sale.
In the Budget for 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the capital gains to claim this exemption.
Please note that this exemption can be taken back if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase/completion of construction.
The capital gains tax exemption limit under Section 54 to 54F is restricted to Rs.10 crore. Earlier, there was no threshold.

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  then One residential house property should be purchased within 1 year before the date of sale of house property or 2 years after the date of sale of house property; (OR) Construct a house property within 3 years after the date of sale of house property.

Section 54F: Exemption on capital gains on sale of any asset other than a house property
Exemption under Section 54F is available when there are capital gains from the sale of a long-term asset other than a house property. You must invest the entire sale consideration and not only capital gain to buy a new residential house property to claim this exemption. Purchase the new property either one year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property. You can also use the gains to invest in the construction of a property. However, the construction must be completed within 3 years from the date of sale.

In Budget 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the sale consideration to claim this exemption. This exemption can be taken back, if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase. If the entire sale proceeds are invested towards the new house, the entire capital gain will be exempt from taxes if you meet the above-said conditions.

However, if you invest a portion of the sale proceeds, the capital gains exemption will be in the proportion of the invested amount to the sale price LTCG exemption = Capital gains x Cost of new house / Net consideration.

Section 54EC: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Reinvesting in specific bonds
Exemption is available under Section 54EC when capital gains from sale of the first property are reinvested into specific bonds.

If you are not keen to reinvest your profit from the sale of your first property into another one, then you can invest them in bonds for up to Rs. 50 lakhs issued by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
The money invested can be redeemed after 5 years, but they cannot be sold before the lapse of 5 years from the date of sale.
The homeowner has six month’s time to invest the profit in these bonds. But to be able to claim this exemption, you will have to invest before the tax filing deadline.
Section 54B: Exemption on Capital Gains From Transfer of Land Used for Agricultural Purpose
When you make short-term or long-term capital gains from transfer of land situated in Urban area used for agricultural purposes – by an individual or the individual’s parents or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) – for 2 years before the sale, exemption is available under Section 54B. The exempted amount is the investment in a new asset or capital gain, whichever is lower. You must reinvest into a new agricultural land (in urban or rural area) within 2 years from the date of transfer. 

The new agricultural land, which is purchased to claim capital gains exemption, should not be sold within a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase. In case you are not able to purchase agricultural land before the date of furnishing of your income tax return, the amount of capital gains must be deposited before the date of filing of return in the deposit account in any branch (except rural branch) of a public sector bank or IDBI Bank according to the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

Exemption can be claimed for the amount which is deposited. If the amount which was deposited as per Capital Gains Account Scheme was not used for the purchase of agricultural land, it shall be treated as capital gains of the year in which the period of 2 years from the date of sale of land expires.

Our handpicked plans can help you build a portfolio that is best suited to your financial goals and risk profile.

Section 54D: Capital Gains on transfer of  land and building which is used for  industrial undertaking 
Conditions to be fulfilled :

There must be compulsory purchase of land and building which is used for an industrial undertaking.
The land and building should have been used by the assessee for purposes of the business of the industrial undertaking in the 2 years before the date of transfer.
The assessee must purchase any other land or building or construct any building (for shifting or re-establishing the existing undertaking or setting up a new industrial undertaking) within 3 years from the date of transfer.
If such investment is not made before the date of filing of return of income, then the capital gain has to be deposited under the CGAS.
Amount of exemption :

If the cost of a new asset is more than or equal to the sale consideration, then the entire capital gain will be exempted.
If the cost of a new asset is lesser than Capital gains, capital gains to the extent of the cost of a new asset is exempt. i.e. the cost of a new asset will be exempted.
When can you invest in Capital Gains Account Scheme?
Finding a suitable seller, arranging the requisite funds and getting the paperwork in place for a new property is one time-consuming process. Fortunately, the Income Tax Department agrees with these limitations. If capital gains have not been invested until the due date of filing of return (usually 31 July) of the financial year in which the property is sold, the gains can be deposited in a PSU bank or other banks as per the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

This deposit can then be claimed as an exemption from capital gains, and no tax has to be paid on it. However, if the money is not invested, the deposit shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the year in which the specified period lapses.

Saving Tax on Sale of Agricultural Land
In some cases, capital gains made from the sale of agricultural land may be entirely exempt from income tax or it may not be taxed under the head capital gains. See below:

a. Agricultural land in a rural area in India is not considered a capital asset and therefore any gains from its sale are not chargeable to tax. For details on what defines an agricultural land in a rural area, see above.

b. Do you hold agricultural land as stock-in-trade? If you are into buying and selling land regularly or in the course of your business, in such a case, any gains from its sale are taxable under the head Business and Profession.

c. Capital gains on compensation received for compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land are tax exempt under Section 10(37) of the Income Tax Act.

If your agricultural land wasn’t sold in any of the above cases, you can seek exemption under Section 54B.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is the benefit of indexation available for computing capital gains arising on sale of a short-term capital asset?


Capital gains is determined by reducing the purchase price from the sale price. However, for an asset that has been held for a long time, it would not be appropriate to determine gains by merely reducing purchase price from sale price without giving any effect to the inflation. Hence, the concept of indexing the purchase price has been brought in. This way, the indexed purchase price can be reduced from sale price to determine gains. So, indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.

Should an NRI pay taxes on gains made on the sale of property in India?


Property sold in India is generally subject to tax deduction. The person buying the property must deduct taxes at the rate applicable to the NRI’s income slab, if the property is a short-term asset. If the property is a long-term asset, 20% LTCG tax is charged. Further, it is important for the NRI to ensure that taxes are deducted on the gains made and not on the sale proceeds. A jurisdictional Assessing Officer can help to determine the gains on which taxes should be deducted by the purchaser.

Can I set off my short-term capital loss against any other head of income?


First and foremost, capital losses can be set off only against capital gains. Accordingly, short-term capital losses can be set off against any income under capital gains be it short-term or long-term. However, long-term capital losses can be set off only against long-term capital gains.

.1: Taxpayer is unable to choose ITR 1/ 4 from drop down for AY 2024-25 as the option is greyed 
off” while filing return?
Ans: In case taxpayer has special rate of Income and TDS is deducted for such income (For Ex: 
115BB), then ITR 1 and ITR 4 are not applicable for such taxpayer. So, the respective dropdowns

Ans: From AY 2024-25, new tax regime has become the default tax regime and VIA deductions cannot 
be claimed, except deduction u/s 80CCD(2)/80CCH/80JJAA as per the provision of Section 
115BAC of the Income Tax Act, 1961. In case taxpayer wants to claim any deductions (as 
applicable), then taxpayer need to choose for old tax regime by selecting “Yes” option in ITR 1 /

Form 10-IEA is a declaration made by the return filers for choosing the ‘Opting Out of New Tax Regime’. An Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person with business or professional income must submit Form 10-IEA if they wish to pay income tax as per the old tax regime. On the other hand, taxpayers who do not have income from business or profession can simply tick the “Opting out of new regime” in the ITR form without the need to file Form 10-IEA. Simply put, only those who file ITR-3, ITR-4 or ITR-5 have to submit Form 10-IEA if they have business income (other than coop societies). Individuals and HUFs filing their returns in Forms ITR-1 or 2 are not required to submit Form 10-IEA.

 

 

I am filing ITR in new regime for AY 2024-25. Can I switch between old and new tax regime in the next years?
An Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person with business or professional income will not be eligible to choose between the two regimes every year. Once they opt out of new tax regime, they have only one chance for switching to new regime. Once they switch back to the new regime, they won’t be able to choose old regime anytime in future. An individual with non business income can switch between the new and old tax regimes every year. Within the same year, again it is emphasized that the choice of old tax regime can be made only before the due date of filing the return u/s 139(1) of I T Act.

 

 

I am having business income and have opted in and opted out from the new regime in the previous years. So, will I be in old regime for the AY 2024-25?
Please note that new tax regime is default regime for AY 2024-25. Any actions in any previous years with respect to choice of regimes will not be applicable from AY 2024-25. You are required to submit Form 10-IEA again in case you want to opt for the old regime.

 

 

I have business income, I have wrongly filed Form 10-IEA but want to file the return under new tax regime. As there is no option to withdraw Form 10-IEA in that case whether my return can be filed under new tax regime?
Once Form 10IEA is filed for AY 2024-25, then it cannot be revoked / withdrawn in same AY. If you wish to re-enter into new tax regime then you can file Form 10IEA for withdrawal option in the next assessment year. Again it is emphasised that that the choice of old tax regime can be made only before the due date of filing the return u/s 139(1) of IT Act.

 

 

I am filing ITR-5. I want to opt out of new tax regime? Whether Form 10-IFA or Form 10- IEA would be applicable to me?
Form 10-IEA is applicable to AOP’s (other than Co-operative society) or BOI or AJP, who are filing return of Income in ITR-5 for AY 2024-25.

Form 10-IFA is applicable to new manufacturing co-operative Societies resident in India filing ITR 5, if they wish to avail New Tax Regime under Section 115BAE for AY 2024-25.

How to calculate income tax payable under new tax regime
For those salaried individuals who are continuing with the new tax regime for the current financial year, 2024-25, should know how to calculate income tax payable. It is important to remember that income tax slabs have been tweaked in new tax regime. Hence, knowing the correct way to calculate is important.

Further, for FY 2024-25, deductions available under new tax regime for a salaried individual have also been tweaked. A salaried individual can claim - i) Standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income instead of Rs 50,000 earlier, and ii) Section 80CCD (2) deduction for employer's contribution to employee's NPS account. This deduction can be claimed for up to 14% of the basic salary of an employee instead of 10% earlier.

Here is an example of how to calculate income tax payable under the new tax regime.

Suppose an individual's gross total income is Rs 20 lakh in FY 2024-25. He/she is eligible for standard deduction of Rs 75,000 in the current financial year and employer has deposited Rs 2 lakh in his/her Tier-I NPS account. This makes him eligible to claim deduction under section 80CCD (2) of the Income-tax Act.

Net taxable income
17,25,000

Hence, the net taxable income on which income tax payable is to be calculated will be Rs 17.25 lakh (Rs 20 lakh minus Rs 2.75 lakh).

Under the new income tax regime, income between 0 to Rs 3 lakh is exempted from tax. Hence, no tax will be payable on this income. After deducting income of Rs 3 lakh from Rs 17.25 lakh the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 14.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000. Thus, out of taxable income of Rs 14.25 lakh, Rs 4 lakh (Rs 7 lakh minus Rs 3 lakh) will be taxed at 5%. The tax payable here will be Rs 20,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 10.25 lakh (Rs 14.25 lakh minus Rs 4 lakh).

The next income tax slab is Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. Out of taxable income of Rs 10.25 lakh, the taxable income of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 10 lakh minus Rs 7 lakh) will be taxed at 10%. The tax payable here will be Rs 30,000. After this, the income left to be taxed will be Rs 7.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 10,00,001 and Rs 12,00,000. Out of the balance income of Rs 7.25 lakh, Rs 2 lakh will be taxed at 15%. The tax payable under this slab will be Rs 30,000. After this income left for chargeable under the tax will be Rs 5.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000. Here out of the taxable income of Rs 5.25 lakh, Rs 3 lakh (Rs 15 lakh minus Rs 12 lakh) will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable amount here will be Rs 60,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 2.25 lakh.

The final income tax slab is for incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The balance taxable income of Rs 2.25 lakh will be taxed at 30%. The tax payable here will be Rs 67,500.

The total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,07,500. In this tax amount, the cess at 4% will be added to this amount for final tax amount payable.

How to calculate income tax liability under old tax regime
The July budget 2024 has kept the income tax slabs under the old tax regime unchanged. If a salaried taxpayer opts for the old tax regime in the current financial year 2024-25, then one can claim various deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime (which is a default tax regime) does not allow claiming various deductions and exemptions except the specified two.

By claiming deductions such as Section 80C, Section 80D, HRA tax exemption etc. one can reduce their gross taxable income and thereby reducing income tax liability.

Remember, the income tax slabs under the old tax regime has different income tax slabs depending on the age of individual in a financial year.

Here is an example on how to calculate income tax payable under the old tax regime.

Suppose an individual aged below 60 years has a gross total income of Rs 17 lakh for the current financial year, i.e., FY 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). An individual has decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year. Further, he/she is eligible to claim following tax exemption and deductions - section 80C for up to Rs 1.5 lakh, section 80CCD(1b) for NPS investment of Rs 50,000, section 80D of Rs 25,000 for medical insurance premium paid and section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 on savings account interest earned.

(25,000)

(10,000)
Net taxable income
14,65,000

After deducting the deductions from the gross total income, one arrives at the net taxable income of Rs 14,65,000. The tax payable will be calculated on the net taxable income.

As per the income tax slab rates table, the first Rs 2.5 lakh from net taxable income will be exempted from tax. This is because there is no tax on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh as per current income tax slabs in the old tax regime. Post this, income left on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 12,15,000 (14,65,000-2,50,000). The second slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh which is taxed at Rs 5%. This means that out of Rs 12,15,000, then next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at 5%. The tax amount will be Rs 12,500.

Now the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 9,65,000. The third slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, taxed at 20%. This means that out Rs 9,65,000, Rs 5,00,000 will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable here will be Rs 1,00,000.

The balance income on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 4,65,000. The tax amount on this balance income (Rs 14,65,000 minus Rs 10,00,000) will be calculated on the basis of the last slab, i.e., above Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 30%. The tax payable amount comes out to be Rs 1,39,500.

Hence, the total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,52,000 (Rs 12,500 + 1,00,000+ 1,39,500).

Do note that cess and surcharge are also levied on the income tax payable. Cess is levied at the rate of 4% and surcharge is levied if the total income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From the example above, the cess amount is Rs 10,080. The surcharge will not be applicable as net taxable income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh. The final tax amount payable by individual is Rs 2,62,080.
How to know which income tax slab you fall in
Individuals, not having business incomes, are required to choose between the two tax regimes in every financial year. Furthermore, an individual needs to know the income tax slabs in which their income will fall. These two factors will help an individual to determine which income tax regime is more beneficial to them.

To know the income tax slabs and rates applicable to your income under any income tax regime, one must first know the taxable income on which tax has to be calculated. If an individual continues with old tax regime, then he/she is eligible to claim tax exemption (such as House Rent Allowance exemption, Leave Travel Allowance exemption, standard deduction) and deductions under sections 80C to 80U, as eligible for. After claiming and deducting the tax exemptions and deductions that an individual is eligible for, he/she arrives at the net taxable income on which income tax payable is calculated.

For example, your gross total income from all sources is Rs 12 lakh and you are eligible to claim deduction of Rs 2.10 lakh under sections 80C, 80TTA, 80CCD(1b). The taxable income on which you have to calculate tax will be Rs 9.9 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 2.10 lakh). Your income tax slab in the old tax regime will be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The tax rate is the 20%.

However, the income tax slabs and income tax rules under the new tax regime have been revised in the July budget 2024. From April 1, 2024, the new tax regime allows standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income and Section 80CCD (2) deduction up to 14% on basic salary for employer's contribution to the employee's Tier-I NPS account.

From the example above, after claiming deduction, the taxable income is, say, Rs 9.9 lakh (Gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh minus Rs 2.10 lakh). The net taxable income of Rs 9.9 lakh falls under the revised income tax slab of Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. This will be taxed at 10%.



Surcharge on income tax
The July budget 2024 has not made any changes in the surcharge rates applicable on the income tax amounts under the new and old tax regimes. If an individual's net taxable income exceeds a specified level, then a surcharge is levied. The surcharge is levied on the income tax payable amount before the levy of cess. According to income tax laws, a surcharge is applicable if an individual's taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From FY 2023-24, the government made changes in the surcharge rates under the new tax regime. The new surcharge rates have come into effect from April 1, 2023.

Surcharge rate from April 1, 2023 under new tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Up to Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore	25%

However, individuals opting for the old tax regime in current FY 2024-25 will continue to pay the surcharge rate they were paying in the previous financial years.

Surcharge rate under old tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Upto Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore but up to Rs 5 crore	25%
More than Rs 5 crore	37%

There are certain exceptions to the surcharge rates mentioned above. If an individual has earned income from capital gains (short term or long term) through the sale of equity shares and equity mutual funds or dividend income, the surcharge will not exceed 15%, irrespective of the income range.

While understanding the concept of surcharge, one must also know the term marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief kicks in when the amount of surcharge on income tax payable exceeds the increase in income over the specified limit.

Suppose an individual has a net taxable income of Rs 51 lakh. As the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, the surcharge will be applicable at the rate of 10%. The tax payable on Rs 51 lakh (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250.

Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where the concept of marginal relief kicks in.

To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is because no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500.

To ascertain the actual income tax payable with surcharge, compare the normal tax liability (before surcharge and cess) and tax liability after marginal tax relief (without cess). Normal tax liability is Rs 13,42,500 and tax liability after marginal tax relief is Rs 14,12,500. The surcharge that will be applicable is Rs 70,000 (Rs 14,12,500 - Rs 13,42,500).

The final tax payable amount will be Rs 13,42, 500 (Tax payable amount) + Rs 70,000 (Surcharge) + Rs 56,500 (Cess at 4% on Rs 14,12,500) = Rs 14,69,000.
Income tax slabs for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021-22 (AY 2022-23) FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24) under new tax regime
Effective from April 1, 2020 (FY 2020-21), an individual has an option to continue with the old tax regime (claim deductions and tax exemptions) or opt for the new tax regime without any deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime when announced was optional in nature and was offering lower tax rate as compared to the old tax regime. However, from FY 2023-24, the new tax regime has become default option. If no tax regime is chosen by the individual, then income tax payable will be calculated using new tax regime now.

Here are latest income tax slabs and rates applicable for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021- 22 (AY 2022-23) and FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24)

Every individual can pay taxes Online or Offline. Please refer to this link for more details.

How are taxes paid to the government?


You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return. If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf. If you are liable to pay advance tax, then you have to pay 90% of it before the 31st of March every financial year. You can file your ITR once the financial year ends.
The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date. It’s worthwhile noting that you attract a late filing fee of Rs.5,000 on failing to file ITR within the due date of the assessment year.

In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).

If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA.

Part / unit which is occupied by you for your residence throughout the year will be treated as an independent property and income from such a part / unit will be computed in the manner as described in the ITR-4 user manual in case of a self-occupied property.
Part / unit which is let out will be treated as an independent property and income from such a part/unit will be computed in the manner as described in the ITR-4 user manual in case of let out property. ​
18. Do I need to file any form if I am claiming deduction u/s 80 DD and 80 U?

From AY 2024-25 new schedules have been added regarding deduction u/s 80 DD and 80 U. If you want to claim deduction u/s 80DD and 80U then you have to mandatorily file from 10 IA before filing the return of Income and enter the details (Date of filing form and acknowledgement no.) of Form 10 IA in Schedule 80 DD and 80 U while filing the return of Income.

19. What is the tax treatment of unrealized rent that is subsequently realized?

Any subsequent recovery of unrealized rent will be deemed to be your income under the head Income from House Property in the year in which such rent is realized (whether or not you are the owner of that property in that year).​ It will be charged to tax after deducting a sum equal to 30% of unrealized rent.​

20. Can my employer PAN be quoted in place of TAN?

No. PAN should never be quoted in the textbox where TAN is to be quoted, as the purposes for which PAN and TAN are allotted are different. TAN is a unique identification number which is allotted to parties who deduct or collect tax at source. PAN is a unique identification number issued to keep a linking of the transactions carried by a person like payment of tax, TDS / TCS credit, Return of Income, Return of Wealth, correspondence with the Income Tax Department or correspondence by the ITD, investments made by a person, loan taken by a person, etc.

21. What is the due date of Filing ITR -4 for AY 2024-25 (FY 2023-24)?

The Finance Act, 2023 has amended the provisions of Section 115BAC to make it the default tax regime from the FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) for the assessee being an Individual, and HUF.

If an assessee does not want to pay tax according to the New tax regime, he will have to explicitly opt out of it and choose to be taxed under the old tax regime.

An assessee having income from a business or profession can opt out of the new tax regime and switch to the old tax regime for a relevant year. However, he has to exercise this option in Form No. 10-IEA on or before the due date for filing the return of income under Section 139(1).

 

 

23. What is Rebate u/s 87 A as per new Tax Regime (Default) and Old tax regime?

 

Currently, section 87A allows individuals to claim a rebate of Rs 12,500 under the old tax regime and Rs 25,000 under the new tax regime.

Till March 31, 2023 (FY 2022-23), section 87A tax rebate under old and new tax regime was available for taxable income up to Rs 5 lakh. Hence, opting for old or new tax regime made no difference for an individual having taxable income up to Rs 5 lakh.

However, to make the new tax regime more attractive, the tax rebate was increased to Rs 25,000 for New Tax regime only. This made zero tax payable for taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh in the new tax regime for FY 2023-24 (from April 1, 2023).

However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime. The old tax regime refers to the system of income tax calculation and slabs that existed before the introduction of the new tax regime. In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions.
In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).

If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA.

Note: NPS has a separate section 80CCD(1B) that allows an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit of section 80C.

ELSS (Equity-Linked Saving Scheme) Mutual Fund
Let us discuss further in detail the tax-saving investment options:-

The equity-linked Saving Scheme is a tax-saving investment option under Section 80C that has two features: First, the investment amount under the ELSS scheme is allowed for tax exemption up to the maximum limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. Second, the Equity-Linked Saving Scheme investment has a lock-in period of 3 years.

The annual return offered by the ELSS funds is approximately between 5%-18% (The interest rate offered by the ELSS funds is not fixed and depends on the market performance of the underlying equities). The returns received are not constant in an equity-linked saving scheme as they vary per the fund's market performance.

This tax-saving investment scheme offers liquidity and flexibility in investment and is best suited for those ready to take risks.

The returns received from ELSS are subject to long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) at 10% if the gain exceeds Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year. However, a top ELSS fund in one period need not be the best for the next period, too. The best ELSS fund should be selected for its performance across the bull and bear market phases.

Moreover, one can track one's investment in the ELSS online simply and hassle-free.

National Pension Scheme (NPS)
As per the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the National Pension Scheme is designed to help individuals save for retirement. National Pension Scheme (NPS) is for both government and private employees. Any age group from 18-70 years can participate in the NPS program.

NPS is a good tax-saving investment option, as fund management charges are pretty low. Fund management is done under four accounts in the NPS scheme: equity, corporate bonds, government securities, and alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in assets such as venture capital, private equity, real estate, etc. These accounts help investors manage their portfolios actively or passively.

There is a tax deduction of Rs. 1,50,000/- for self-contribution to NPS, which is covered under Section 80C. Under Section 80CCD(1B), an additional deduction of Rs. 50,000 is allowed against the contribution to NPS. Therefore, this scheme provides a tax benefit of up to Rs. 2 lakh.

Employer’s NPS Contribution is covered under section 80CCD(2) of the Income Tax Act.

Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)
Unit Linked Insurance Plan is the most versatile tax-saving investment option as it allows you to invest in debt, equity, or both, according to your requirement and risk appetite. Therefore, investing in insurance is beneficial in terms of both investment and saving.

Insurance provides financial security for the whole family and a tax-free lump sum amount on maturity. The premium paid towards purchasing a life insurance policy qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, the final amount received on maturity is tax-free as per Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act.

Public Provident Fund (PPF)
PPF is a very commonly heard term among taxpayers. PPF falls under the exempt tax status, hence the reason for its popularity. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office, but they can also be transferred from one branch to another or from post office to bank and vice versa.

The amount invested during the financial year for the PPF qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The interest and the maturity amount are exempt from tax under section 10 of the Income Tax Act. The PPF account lock-in tenure is 15 years.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is one of the essential tax-saving investment options. Launched under the government’s “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” campaign, SSY focuses on improving girl-child life. The scheme allows the taxpayer to deposit some amount in the account regularly and earn interest simultaneously. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana also qualifies for deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The minimum amount is Rs.250, and the scheme matures 21 years or till the girl child gets married, whichever is earlier after the account opening.

Interest accrues on the SSY Account, which gets compounded annually, is eligible for tax exemption under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

Maturity proceeds or any withdrawal amount is also exempt from tax under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

National Savings Certificate (NSC)
National Saving Certificate is a fixed-income investment scheme that is aimed at small- and middle-income investors. NSC is a good tax-saving investment option as the risk is low and is as secure as the provident fund. Moreover, the investment in NSC qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

The interest earned is also added back to the initial investment and is eligible for tax exemption.

The features of the NSC tax-saving investment option are as follows:

A guaranteed return of 6.8% annual interest.
A tax benefit of up to Rs. 1.5Lakh
Investment can be made as low as Rs. 1,000 (or multiples of Rs. 100)
The investor will receive the entire maturity value, which will be taxed to the taxpayer.
Senior Citizen Saving Scheme
As the name suggests, the Senior Citizen Saving scheme is available to senior citizens who are residents of India. This scheme offers one of the highest rates among the various saving schemes. Although this scheme's lock-in period is five years, the depositors can extend the maturity period by another three years. Moreover, the depositors can make investments with a minimum amount of Rs.1000 and multiples thereof.

The Senior Citizen Saving Scheme investment qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C. The interest on such deposits is taxable and liable for tax if the interest exceeds Rs. 50,000.

Bank FDs
Fixed deposits are considered one of the risk-free tax saving investment schemes. The bank decides the interest rate on a minimum lock-in period of five years. In the scenario of a joint account, the primary holder can avail of the benefit of tax deduction while calculating the taxable income. Additionally, senior citizens get the maximum benefits from a higher interest rate on investment. Premature withdrawal is not allowed in the tax-saver bank fixed deposits.

Investors can claim a maximum deduction of Rs. 1.5 Lakh by investing in a tax-saving FD A/c.

Interest earned from Saving Accounts Deposits under 80 TTA
All taxpayers can avail of a tax deduction on the interest generated from savings account deposits within limits. This interest can be from savings accounts in banks, post offices, or accounts in cooperative societies involved in the banking business. This tax-saving investment option is for ordinary taxpayers, not senior citizens.

The maximum deduction limit is Rs. 10,000 under this section, which includes the interest earned from all the savings accounts one has. Beyond this limit, any interest earned will be taxable.

Under Section 80TTB, the benefit of the least tax implication on interest income is provided for a senior citizen. Under this section, a deduction up to Rs. 50,000 or an amount from a particular income is allowed from the total gross income.

Interest paid toward the repayment of the Education Loan
Under Section 80E, students who take education loans to fulfill their education dreams are offered a tax exemption on the interest repayment. There is no cap on the deduction to be claimed. Tax deduction claims can be made from the start of the year when the payer starts paying the interest on the education loan and within the seven immediately subsequent financial years or until the interest is completely paid, whichever is earlier.

Premium paid toward the Health Insurance Policies or incurred medical expenses in case of senior citizens
The total taxable income towards the premium paid on Health insurance and expenses incurred towards healthcare is allowed for tax deductions under Section 80D. The limit to claim this deduction depends on the taxpayer’s family situation:-



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Eligibility                                                   | Exemption Limit                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Health insurance for self and family (spouse and children)    | Rs. 25,000                             |
| For self and family + parents                                 | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 25,000 = Rs. 50,000   |
| For self and family (below 60 years) + Parents above 60 years | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 75,000   |
| For self and family (with members above 60 years) +           | Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 |
| senior citizen parents                                        |                                        |

Interest Paid toward Home Loan
Under Section 24 (b), interest payments toward home loans can be claimed. The maximum limit that a taxpayer gets on the interest payment of a home loan is Rs. 2 lakhs if the house property is self-occupied.

Further, in those cases where the home loan taken for the property is not self-occupied but instead is rented, there is no limit on maximum tax deductions. A deduction can be taken on the whole interest amount.

Payouts on the maturity of the Life Insurance Plan
As per section 10(10D), all the incomes received from a life insurance plan upon maturity, surrender, or death of the policyholder are tax-free.

Exemption of House Rent paid (if mentioned in salary break-up)
If there is no HRA added to your salary break-up because you work in some small, medium-sized companies. In this case, you can claim deductions on the rent paid for furnished/unfurnished accommodation as per Section 80GG. The same rule applies to self-employed people, too. The conditions to claim the deductions are:-

Must not have received HRA during any part of the fiscal year
Should not be possessing any house in the city of occupation
Individuals should not own a house in the city of occupation in the name of spouse, minor child, or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) of which the person is a member.
Owning a house in any other city different from the occupation city is eligible for deductions, but it shouldn’t be self-occupied or left vacant.
The amount of deduction under this provision exempts up to the lowest value of the listed parameters:

The rent paid more than 10% of the total income
25% of the total income after adjustment
a maximum of ₹5,000 per month.
Hence, the maximum deduction allowed during the year is ₹60,000.

Deduction of House Rent paid (if not mentioned in salary break-up)
Under Section 10(13A) Income Tax Act offers tax benefits in the minimum value of the following:-

Actual annual rent allowance disbursed by the employer
50% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) if the house is situated in metro cities or 40% of the Basic Salary plus DA if the house is situated in other cities.
Actual rent paid for the house – 10% of basic pay plus DA.
In the above calculations, DA will be considered if it forms a part of retirement benefits.

Donations made to Charitable Institutions
Deductions can be claimed for the donations made to approved charitable institutions under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. The condition is that the donation should have been made by any mode other than cash, as cash donations exceeding Rs. 2,000 do not qualify as deductions.

Further, to claim this deduction, a taxpayer needs a stamped receipt from the institution they have made the donation, with details of the name of the trust, address, PAN Number of the Trust, the amount of donation, etc.

Donations to Scientific Research and Rural Development
Taxpayers can claim deductions under Section 80GGA for the donations made for scientific research and rural development. There is no cap, and 100% of the income spent is eligible for the deduction, provided the transaction is made via a bank account if the donation exceeds Rs. 10,000/-.

Donations to Political Parties
Under Section 80GGC, the entire income spent on the donation towards political parties is waived off from tax calculations, provided the transaction is made via a bank account. Also, the political party to which the donation is made must be registered under Section 29A of the Representation of People Act (RPA) of 1951.

Medical expenses for the disabled person
Under Section 80DD, individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) can claim deductions of the amount spent for the treatment and well-being of a disabled dependent family member. However, this claim is offered only to the legal family of such dependent individuals.

Based on the percentage of disability, if people have 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If people have disabilities, more than 80% can, they claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Flat Deduction for Disabled Person on the Basis of Severity of Disability
Under Section 80U, the disabled individual can claim tax deductions if a registered medical authority documents the disability with a minimum 40% impairment.

If the disabled individual has 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If individuals have disabilities of more than 80%, they can claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Individuals Diagnosed With Specific Diseases or Disability
Under Section 80DDB, individuals can claim exemptions on subsequent income spent on the treatment of dependent family members diagnosed with specific diseases. These critical illnesses include neurological disorders, AIDS, chronic renal disease, malignant cancers, and hematological ailments. For individuals below 60, a maximum of Rs. 40,000 is disbursed, and the same increases to Rs. 1 lakh for senior and super senior citizens.

Interest Earned on Deposits by Senior Citizens
Senior citizens take a heavy charge on their finances because of the expenditure on medical expenses. Relaxation from tax deductions helps senior citizens to simplify their lives. Under Section 80 TTB, senior citizens aged 60 years and above can claim Rs. 50,000 or a specified amount as a deduction from their gross total income for that fiscal year.

How to Plan your Tax Saving Investments for the Year?
Planning your tax-saving investments for the year requires strategic thinking to ensure you meet your financial goals while reducing your tax liability. Here's how to plan effectively:

Understand Your Tax Liability

Review your total taxable income and estimate the tax liability based on the applicable tax slab.
Identify areas where you can claim deductions or exemptions to reduce taxable income.
Choose the Right Investment Tools

Section 80C: Invest in options like PPF, ELSS, NSC, or Tax-saving FD, which offer up to ₹1.5 lakh in deductions.
National Pension Scheme (NPS): Contributions to NPS are eligible for additional deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) up to ₹50,000.
Health Insurance (Section 80D): Premiums paid for health insurance can give you deductions, which is beneficial for families and senior citizens.
Home Loan Repayment (Section 80C and 24B): Claim deductions on principal repayment and interest paid on home loans.
Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance

Select investments according to your risk appetite—ELSS funds for aggressive investors or PPF for a safer, long-term bet.
Consider mixing different investment types to balance growth and risk.
Plan for Long-Term Goals

Focus on long-term growth instruments such as NPS or PPF to not only save tax but also secure your retirement and long-term financial goals.
Avoid frequent withdrawal from tax-saving instruments to maximize growth.
Consider Tax-Free Income

Invest in tax-free instruments like the Public Provident Fund (PPF) or tax-free bonds that generate interest without adding to your tax burden.
Monitor and Adjust Your Portfolio

Regularly review your investments to make sure they align with your changing tax and financial needs.
Rebalance your portfolio annually, especially if tax-saving limits are reached or if tax laws change.
Make Investments Before the Deadline

Be mindful of the deadlines, typically before the end of the financial year (31st March), to claim deductions for the current year.

Home Loan Tax Benefit - How To Save Income Tax On Your Home Loan?

5 min read


If you are acquiring a home by taking a loan, then you can claim deductions on interest portion that you repay as a part of EMI, in accordance with the regulations of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 

While obtaining a housing loan can be costly, it is also possible to benefit from several tax deductions that can help you save money on taxes each year. It is important to understand how to maximize these benefits.

Home Loan Tax Benefit
Impact of New Tax Regime on Home Loan Benefits
Home Loan benefits under the old tax regime remain the same as one can avail deductions without any restrictions, however, the under new tax regime benefits are curtailed, let’s know in detail about the same

Deduction under section 80C for the payment towards principal component of the home loan, stamp duty, registration charges and Section 80EE, Section 80EEA are not available
Deduction under section 24(b) for the payment towards the interest component of the home loan is not available for self-occupied property.
However, deduction under section 24b is available for let-out property. If net income from let out property results in loss, then such loss will be allowed to set off against profit from another house property but not allowed to set off against other heads of income like salary or other sources.
Deduction for Interest Paid on Housing Loan under Section 24
A loan must be taken for the purchase or construction of a house property to claim a tax deduction. If it is taken for the construction of a house, then construction must be completed within five years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken.

The interest portion of the home loan EMI for the year can be claimed as a deduction from your total income up to a maximum of Rs 2 lakh under Section 24. 

From the assessment year 2018-19 onwards, the maximum deduction for interest paid on self-occupied house property is Rs 2 lakh.

For let out property, there is no upper limit for claiming tax exemption on interest, which means that you can claim deduction on the entire interest paid on your home loan. 

In case the construction exceeds the stipulated time, i.e. 5 years, you can claim deductions on interest of home loan only up to Rs 30,000 for the financial year.

ITR Filing Last Date 2024
The last date to file Income Tax Return (ITR) for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) without a late fee is 31st July 2024.

Deduction on Interest Paid Towards Home Loan During the Pre-Construction Period
Say you bought an under-construction property and have not moved in yet but you are paying the EMIs. In this case, your eligibility to claim interest on the home loan as a deduction begins only upon completion of construction or immediately if you buy a fully constructed property. 

So, does this mean you would not enjoy any tax benefits on the interest paid during the period falling between the borrowing of loan and completion of construction? Yes, it will be available but with some conditions and in future years.

Let’s understand how. 

The Income Tax Act allows you to claim a deduction for such interest, which is also called pre-construction interest. You are allowed to deduct it in five equal instalments starting from the year the property is acquired or construction is completed, over and above the deduction you are otherwise eligible to claim from your house property income. However, the maximum eligibility remains capped at Rs 2 lakh.

For example, you availed a home loan in April 2021 for construction and paid an interest of Rs 10,000 a month. Construction of the house was completed in April 2023 after two years. Hence, you can start claiming the pre-construction interest of Rs 2.4 lakh (approx) paid by you only after the construction gets completed in five equal instalments starting from the year 2023-24. Maximum interest deduction under Section 24(b) is capped at Rs 2 lakh (including current year interest + pre-construction interest). So if you paid interest of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year 2023-24 then you can claim a total interest deduction of Rs. 1,68,000 (i.e., Rs. 1,20,000 as current year interest and Rs. 48,000 as 1/5th installment of pre-construction interest).

Further, if your home loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80EEA, you can claim an additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh over and above the limit of Rs. 2 lakhs u/s 24(b). We have discussed Section 80EEA later in this article.

Deduction on Principal Repayment under Section 80C
The principal paid on the home loan EMI for the year is allowed as a deduction under section 80C. The maximum amount that can be claimed under this section is up to Rs 1.5 lakh.

But to claim this deduction, the house property should not be sold within five years of possession. Otherwise, the deduction claimed earlier will be added back to your income in the year of sale.

Deduction for Stamp Duty and Registration Charges under Section 80C
Besides claiming the deduction for principal repayment, a deduction for stamp duty and registration charges can also be claimed under Section 80C but within the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. 

However, it can be claimed only in the year these expenses are incurred.

Additional Deduction under Section 80EE
Additional deduction under Section 80EE is allowed to the home buyers for a maximum of up to Rs 50,000. To claim this deduction, the following conditions should be met:

The amount of loan taken should be Rs 35 lakh or less, and the property’s value shall not exceed Rs 50 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2017.
And on the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first-time house owner.
Additional Deduction under Section 80EEA
To promote the housing sector, Budget 2019 has introduced an additional deduction under Section 80EEA for homebuyers for a maximum of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. 

To claim this deduction, below mentioned conditions should be met:

The stamp value of the property does not exceed Rs 45 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022 (extended from 31 March 2021)
On the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first time home buyer.
The individual should not be eligible to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA if claiming a deduction under Section 80EE.
Deduction for Joint Home Loan
If the loan is taken jointly, each loan holder can claim a deduction for home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh each and principal repayment under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh each in their tax returns.

To claim this deduction, they should also be co-owners of the property taken on loan. So, a loan taken jointly with your family member can help you claim a larger tax benefit.

Loss under the Head House Property
If you have not let-out any of your house property then there are high chances that you might incur a loss under the head house property, reason being the interest deduction that you might avail u/s 24(b). Further, even if you have rented out the property, you can incur a loss under the head house property because there is no limit on interest on home loan deductions so your interest can exceed your rental income.

However, in any of the cases the overall loss incurred during the year under the head ‘Income from House Property’ that can be set off against any other head of income is Rs 2 lakh only. If you have incurred a loss above Rs. 2 lakhs then you cannot set off such losses during the current year, but you are allowed to carry forward such losses for 8 years and claim the same against your income from house property in future years.

About NPS
NPS, or National Pension System, is a government-sponsored pension scheme available to both salaried and self-employed individuals. It offers dual benefit:

Tax savings during your working years
A regular income stream after retirement 
NPS is one of the most popular options for individuals seeking to create a retirement corpus and a regular monthly income. The money deposited in NPS is invested in various securities and investment avenues, including the equity market. It is widely regarded as one of the cheapest investment options with equity exposure. As the returns are directly related to the market performance, there is no guarantee of any particular amount. Still, over a period of time, returns from NPS have been among the highest in the market.

Two Types of NPS Accounts
There are two types of accounts in NPS, NPS Tier 1 and NPS Tier 2.

Tier 1 Account (Pension Account):This has a fixed lock-in period until the subscriber reaches the age of 60 years. Only partial withdrawal is allowed, with certain conditions. Contributions made towards Tier 1 are tax deductible and qualify for deductions under Section 80CCD(1) and Section 80CCD(1B). This means you can invest up to Rs. 2 lakhs in an NPS Tier 1 account and claim a deduction for the full amount, i.e. Rs. 1.50 lakh under Sec 80CCD(1) and Rs. 50,000/- under Section 80CCD(1B).
Tier 2 Account (Additional Account): This is a voluntary savings account that allows subscribers to make withdrawals as and when they like. Only the contributions made by a Central government employee to a Tier 2 account are eligible for tax deduction. To open a Tier 2 account, you must open a Tier 1 account first. The deposits made in the NPS Tier II accounts are eligible for an income tax deduction, under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, for government employees. On the other hand, there is no income tax deduction offered on NPS Tier II deposits for private-sector employees and the gains in the NPS Tier 2 are taxable at the respective slab rates.
Eligibility under Section 80CCD(1B)
An individual taxpayer is eligible to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(1B) by filing the income tax return under the old tax regime. 

However, there is an age restriction for opening an NPS account. The following individuals can open NPS:

Resident individuals between 18-70 years  
Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) aged between 18-70 years. However, if NRI’s citizenship changes after investing in NPS, the scheme will be terminated. 
How to Invest in NPS to Avail Tax Benefits?
Individuals can invest in NPS online or offline. NPS account can be opened online through the NSDL e-Gov portal, now known as protean. It can also be opened offline through a financial institution acting as a Point of Presence (POP). Most banks and non-banking financial companies are authorised to act as POPs. 

Things to Note while Claiming Deductions Under Section 80CCD(1B)
Here are some of the critical points about Section 80CCD(1B) that you should be aware of:

Individuals must file their taxes under the old tax regime, i.e., opting out of the applicability of sec 115BAC(1A).
The additional deduction of Rs. 50,000/- is available only for contributions made to NPS Tier 1 accounts
Tier 2 accounts are not eligible to claim the deduction under Section 80CCD(1B)
The deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) are available to salaried individuals as well as to self-employed individuals
You need to produce documentary evidence of the transaction related to the contribution to NPS
Partial withdrawals are allowed under NPS but are subject to specific terms and conditions
The total exemption limit under Section 80CCD(1B) is Rs. 50,000/- and is independent of exemptions under Section 80C. Thereby, you can claim a maximum deduction of  Rs. 2 lakhs
In case the assessee dies and the nominee decides to close the NPS account, then the amount received by the nominee is exempt from taxation
Documents Required to Claim Tax Benefit Under NPS

The following documents are required to be submitted while investing in NPS:

Bank account statement
PAN card
Aadhaar card
Taxation on NPS Withdrawal

If partial withdrawals are made from the account, then only 25% of the contribution made is exempt from taxation. If the assessee is an employee and decides to close the NPS account or opt out of NPS, then only 40% of the total amount is tax-exempt. The assessee can withdraw 60% of the entire amount upon reaching the age of 60 as tax-free income. The remaining 40% is also tax-free if it is used to purchase an annuity plan. 

Section 80CCD(1B) offers you an excellent opportunity to save a substantial amount on your taxation liabilities. This way, you can not only reduce your present tax liabilities but also work towards creating a substantial corpus for your retirement. Remember the points mentioned above, taking any action related to your NPS account regarding Section 80CCD(1B).

The purpose of the Public Provident Fund (PPF), which was first implemented in India in 1968, was to mobilise small contributions for investment and return. It can also be referred to as an investment vehicle that enables one to accumulate retirement funds while reducing yearly taxes. Anyone looking for a safe investment option to save taxes and earn guaranteed returns should open a PPF account.


How Important is PPF?
The PPF (Public Provident Fund) is considered an excellent investment option, especially for people uncomfortable with taking risks. While the returns may not be very high because they depend on the market, they offer stability. Additionally, investing in PPF can help diversify your portfolio and has tax benefits.


However, please note that to receive interest on your PPF investments, they must be made on or before the 5th of each month, as the interest is calculated on the lowest balance at the credit of account between the close of the fifth day and the end of the month. 

What is PPF Account?
PPF – Key Information
Interest Rate	7.1% per annum.
Minimum Investment Amount	Rs.500
Maximum Investment Amount	Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.
Tenure	15 years
Risk Profile	Offers guaranteed, risk-free returns
Tax Benefit	Up to Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C
Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a long-term investment option that offers an attractive rate of interest and returns on the amount invested.

Features of PPF account
Below are the essential features of PPF

Tenure: The PPF has a minimum tenure of 15 years, which can be extended in blocks of 5 years as per your wish.
Investment limits: PPF allows a minimum investment of Rs 500 and a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh for each financial year. Investments can be made in a lump sum or in a maximum of 12 instalments.
Opening balance: The account can be opened with just Rs 100 a month. Annual investments above Rs 1.5 lakh will not earn interest and will not be eligible for tax savings.
Deposit frequency: Deposits into a PPF account have to be made at least once every year for 15 years.
Mode of deposit: The deposit into a PPF account can be made either by way of cash, cheque, demand draft (DD) or through an online fund transfer.
Nomination: A PPF account holder can designate a nominee for his account either at the time of opening the account or subsequently.
Joint accounts: A PPF account can be held only in the name of one individual. Opening an account in joint names is not allowed.
Risk factor: Since PPF is backed by the Indian government, it offers guaranteed, risk-free returns as well as complete capital protection. The element of risk involved in holding a PPF account is minimal. As the returns from PPF accounts are fixed, they are used as a diversification tool for the investor’s portfolio. 
Tax benefit: The PPF interest and maturity amount are tax-free under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Partial withdrawal: PPF amount can be withdrawn partially from the 5th financial year onwards.
What is PPF Interest Rate?
The PPF interest rate for 2024-25 is 7.1% p.a., which is compounded annually. 
However, to receive the PPF interest for the deposit month, it is very important that you deposit your PPF amount within 5th of that month.


The Finance Ministry sets the interest rate every year, which is paid on 31st March. The interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the 5th day and the last day of every month. Thus, if you invest in PPF after the 5th day of the month, it will not be considered for interest calculation, and the balance which is there on the 5th day will be taken into consideration.

In a nutshell, the PPF contribution made on the 5th of a month will earn interest for that month, while any PPF contribution made after the 5th of the month will not earn interest and result in a loss of interest for that month.

Further, use our PPF calculator to figure out the returns you can expect on investing a certain amount in a PPF account.

Subject to certain conditions, you can also make partial and premature withdrawals from the PPF account. Upon completing the tenure, you can choose to extend the account with or without making additional contributions. You also have the option to close the account.

How to Activate an Inactive PPF Account?
In order to reactivate an inactive PPF account, you can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Submit a written letter to the bank or post office branch requesting to reactivate it.

Step 2: Pay a minimum amount of Rs.500 for each year you have not made any contributions along with the penalty of Rs.50 per inactive year.

Step 3: The bank or PO will process your request and reactivate the account.


PPF vs Mutual Funds
The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a savings scheme provided by the government, which offers guaranteed returns. However, there are other investment options available, such as mutual funds, that also offer tax-saving advantages. Mutual funds are investment vehicles that distribute funds among different types of assets, like stocks and bonds. They gather money from multiple investors and make strategic investments in securities.


Mutual funds have the potential to provide higher returns and greater liquidity compared to PPF. They are classified into different categories based on the asset class, such as equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. It's worth noting that only Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) among mutual funds are eligible for tax savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

Mutual funds have a proven history of delivering returns that have surpassed the market, making them a widely chosen investment option. Each category of mutual funds has its investment objective and level of risk.

Which is a Better Option: PPF or FD?
Public Provident Funds (PPF) and Fixed Deposits (FDs) provide guaranteed returns in the form of interest. However, there are significant differences between the two:

Tenure: FDs offer flexible tenures ranging from as short as 7 days to as long as 10 years, giving investors the freedom to select a duration that aligns with their preferences. On the contrary, PPF has a fixed tenure of 15 years, providing a stable and long-term savings option.

Taxation: PPF provides tax-free returns, while FDs are subject to taxation, including TDS.

Interest Rates: FD interest rates are determined by individual banks and can vary from one bank to another. Moreover, senior citizens often receive preferential treatment with higher interest rates on their FDs than regular citizens.

Loan Options: PPF allows for loans against the account, but the maximum loan amount is limited to 25% of the balance after 1 year. On the other hand, FDs also provide the option to take loans, allowing borrowers to access up to 90% of their deposit amount. The interest rate on an FD loan is usually 1-2 percentage points higher than the prevailing FD interest rate.

Loan Types: FDs can serve as collateral for different types of loans, such as home loans, business loans, and education loans, among others. The bank and the specific loan type determine the loan interest rate.

Is LIC better than Public Provident Fund?
There is often confusion regarding the difference between investment and insurance. Insurance protects against risks, while investment aims to secure a stable financial future. Investors must prioritise their financial well-being by maintaining an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses, obtaining insurance coverage for protection against accidents or unforeseen events, and saving for a secure future.

Having insurance is crucial for investors who have dependents relying on their income. There are different types of insurance schemes available, including term insurance, ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans), and endowment plans. However, it is advisable to prioritise a term insurance policy for adequate coverage and consider investing in a PPF for long-term savings.

A cost-effective approach to combining insurance and investment security is by opting for a term insurance policy along with a PPF. Rather than comparing the superiority of LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) and PPF, the emphasis should be on selecting an appropriate term policy that complements the PPF and meets your insurance needs.

Insurance plans with investment options like ULIPs can indeed have high expense ratios and hidden charges. Therefore, it is generally recommended to separate investment and insurance needs. Choosing a term insurance policy alongside investing in a PPF is a prudent strategy that allows individuals to enjoy the benefits of insurance and investment without unnecessary complexities. This approach ensures a clear and straightforward approach to meet both objectives effectively.

Public Provident Fund (PPF) Limitations
PPF accounts do have certain drawbacks that should be considered:

1. Lock-in Period: PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years, which is longer than other tax-saving investments like Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) with a lock-in period of just three years. This extended lock-in period can pose challenges in case of emergencies or when there is a need for funds during the investment period. As discussed earlier, premature withdrawals are allowed in PPF, but there are restrictions and regulations on when and how much you can withdraw. Therefore, it's important to ensure that you can commit to investing in a PPF account for 15 years.

2. Moderate Interest Rate: The interest rate offered on PPF accounts is not very high, especially considering it is a long-term investment scheme. In contrast, ELSS has the potential to provide double-digit returns to investors.

3. No Joint Holding: PPF accounts cannot be held jointly, which can be a limitation if you intend to open a joint account with your spouse or other family members.

4. Investment Limit: The maximum amount that can be invested in a PPF account in a year is ₹1.5 lakh. However, there is no limit to the amount you can invest in other tax-saving instruments like ELSS funds, NPS, or FDs, although the maximum tax benefit that can be claimed remains the same at ₹1.5 lacks under Section 80C.

5. NRI Restrictions: While resident Indians can open new PPF accounts, this option is unavailable for NRIs. If you had a PPF account as a resident Indian and have become an NRI, you can continue making deposits into the account, but you cannot open new PPF accounts.


6. Annual Contribution Requirement: PPF mandates a minimum annual contribution to keep the account active. Failing to contribute the minimum amount can lead to the account becoming inactive, and reactivating it requires paying a penalty.

Considering these drawbacks, it is important to carefully evaluate your financial goals and circumstances before investing in a PPF account.

Conclusion 
If you prefer low-risk investments and value the security provided by government-backed instruments, PPF can be a suitable choice.

Login
Login to your Cleartax account and click on ‘Start Filing’.

ITR filing page of ClearTax
Create an Account or Login with ClearTax
Create a new account or simply click on Login if you are already a user of ClearTax.

Create an account or Login
Link Your PAN
Linking your PAN allows us to submit your return to the income tax department. 

If you are filing with us for the first time, you need to link your PAN by entering your PAN, Date of Birth, and the OTP received on your registered mobile number. You can verify the OTP using either your 'Aadhaar registered mobile number' or ‘IT Department registered mobile number.’

Link your Pan to e-file
Pre-fill Your Personal Information
If you have previously filed with Cleartax and your PAN is already linked, you will directly see the autofill screen. To pre-fill your information from the income tax department, you will need to complete another OTP verification. This OTP verification is to capture all your personal information and income details in your income tax return with maximum security of your data.


If you choose the 'IT Department' option, you will need to enter two OTPs, one sent to your mobile number and the other to your email.

Too many OTPs can seem a lot of effort, but it is totally worth it! Most of your information will be auto-filled. This saves you nearly 2 hours of your time that would have been spent manually entering and correcting details. Review the auto-filled information and modify if necessary.

Pre-fill information
Upload Form 16
Scroll down and find the 'Upload Form 16' option. By uploading your Form 16, your salary details will be automatically captured. If you do not have Form 16, you can still proceed directly to e-filing by clicking on “Continue to e-file”. You can also upload multiple Form-16's if you have switched jobs in the Financial Year.

Form 16 upload
Form 16 successful

ClearTax will then automatically calculate your income along with the exemptions, deductions, etc., based on the details provided in FORM-16. You will now be redirected to this page, where you can see all your personal details, such as your name, address, bank details, etc.

Note: If you prefer skipping the pre-fill option, you can manually enter the details.

Here, you will see 4 tabs: Personal Info, Income Sources, Tax Saving and Tax Summary. 

Personal Information
All your personal details like name, address and other details will appear here. You can expand each section and review these details. You also have the option to edit them, if required. 

Personal Information 
Income Sources
Go to the ‘Income Sources’ tab. 

Salary
If you didn't upload Form 16 earlier, you can upload it here and fill in the salary details.

Salary Income
Rental Income or House property
Enter the income from house property, considering whether you occupy the house or have rented it out.

Income from House property
Capital gain
If you have sold assets like stocks, mutual funds, Gold, bonds, shares received as a part of ESOP or RSU scheme, land or building, then the profit/loss from such transactions must be reported under capital gains section. 

Capital gains

1. Stocks and Mutual Funds: 
Simply choose your stockbroker from the available options and log in to your investment account. Your capital gains will be calculated within seconds. Cleartax can effortlessly import and process thousands of transactions from your profit and loss (P&L) report to accurately determine the capital gains amount.
If you have done any intraday transactions, they will be automatically categorized as business income rather than capital gains. 
We don’t have the login option for some brokers yet, but you can directly drag and drop or upload the P&L report here. 
If your broker is not listed, you can download the excel template, fill in the required details, and upload the completed template.
For mutual funds, you should upload the P&L report from CAMS or Karvy by selecting their respective icons. You can also navigate to the "Mutual Funds" tab, where you will find CAMS, KARVY, and a few other brokers. Upload the P&L report here and your capital gains will be computed. If you have non-demat mutual funds, please upload files from both Karvy and CAMS. However, if you don't have the excel files or if your broker's name is not listed, you can manually add the details as well.
2. US or foreign stocks
A separate section is dedicated to reporting capital gain details from foreign stocks. Similar to stocks, you can either import the details directly from your broker. Currently, we support transactions from brokers like INDMoney and Vested. Even if your broker isn't mentioned, you can use our excel template to report all the transactions at once.

3. ESOPs and RSUs
If you have sold the shares received under ESOP or RSU scheme, you can add the following details under this section:

type of shares (that is, whether they are listed or not listed), 
date of purchase and sale and 
value of purchase-sale and brokerage expenses. 
Your capital gains will be calculated. 

Likewise, you can add details for all the other assets like Bonds, gold, land and buildings

Professional, Freelancing and Business Income
So broadly, there are 5 sub-sections here:

The first section is 44ADA- this is for professionals. 
The income tax law has specified a few professions and made it clear that only these professionals can opt for 44ADA: 
- Legal
- Medical
- Engineering
- Architecture
- Accountancy
- Technical Consultancy
- Interior Decoration
- Film Artists like cameraman, producer, editor, actor, director, singer, etc are specified.

Under the “Nature of Business”, you will find approximately 40 codes. Select the appropriate code. If you're unsure of the code, simply search for your profession. Also, mention the trade name and description. If you have multiple professions, you can include them all. 
The next condition here is that your revenue should be less than equal to 75 lakhs. If your revenue is more than 75 lakhs, you will have to file taxes normally and you will not be eligible to opt for the presumptive scheme. Revenue is nothing but the total amount you have received for the service offered. It is also called gross receipts. Some folks call it consultation fees. For example, if you are  a practicing lawyer and your clients pay you 1 lakh rupees towards a case, that 1 lakh would be considered as Revenue. 
The other condition is that your expenses cannot be more than 50% i.e. by default it is assumed that your expenses or cost will not be more than 50% of your income. Say your revenue is 20 lakhs, then your expenses has to be up to 10 lakhs. You can show a lower amount say 7 lakhs, then you’ll pay taxes on 13 lakhs but you cannot show a higher amount than 10 lakhs. Let’s add 12 lakhs. If you enter an incorrect amount, you will see error prompts immediately which will guide you whether you are eligible for the presumptive scheme or not. So there is no scope of mistake here.

You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.
Now let’s look at the second section, i.e. 44AD
44AD is mainly for small businesses say a private tutor, web designer, freelance content writer, small business owners. Just like there were some conditions under 44ADA, there are some conditions for 44AD too. 
- The first condition is that your turnover, i.e. nothing but your sales, must be less than 3 crores and 
- the second condition is that your profit must be more than or equal to 8% of your turnover. So if your revenue is say 1 crore, then your profit should be atleast 8 lakhs and you will have to pay taxes on this profit.
But if you have received the money through digital means, then you can pay taxes on only 6% profit instead of 8%. Even if you have received them through Phonepe or GooglePay, that would be considered as digital means. Here again, you will have to select the nature of business, trade name etc There are nearly 200 codes you can choose from.
Add the sales amount you’ve received through digital and non-digital modes separately here. The profit for digital transactions should be atleast 6% and for non-digital it should be atleast 8%. Now you can fill up the assets and liabilities details and proceed. 
There will be some freelancers who would be working independently and running unrelated small businesses too. So they can declare income under both 44AD and 44ADA, as long as the conditions are met.
If your revenue and expense conditions are not met, then you can fill in all the details under the third section. We will automatically select the correct ITR form for you, i.e. ITR-3.
You can add all your other business income here and fill up the Balance sheet and P&L
You have to fill all the Financial particulars if you have the presumptive income. You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why is income tax return filing important?

The income tax department has mandated to file the return to individuals only in case their income is above the basic exemption limit or if they meet specific criteria like expenditure on foreign travel is more than Rs 2 lakh and electricity consumption of Rs 1 lakh or more, deposits of an amount/aggregate of an amount above Rs 1 crore in one or more current accounts, and other conditions that the government will notify.

Later, the government provided additional conditions via a notification dated 21st April 2022. It has notified below conditions where the taxpayer is required to file ITR: 

Total business turnover/sales/gross receipts during the FY exceeds Rs 60 lakh.
Total gross receipts of the profession exceed Rs 10 lakh during the FY.
The aggregate of TDS and TCS during the FY is Rs 25000 or more (for senior citizens, there is an increased limit of Rs 50,000).
Total savings bank account deposits are Rs 50 lakh or more during the FY.
Other scenarios where it is mandatory to file ITR includes:

In the case of a resident whose asset is located outside India or has signing authority for an account based outside India. It is always good to file your ITR even if you are not eligible due to the benefits.

Filing of ITR creates a valid proof of income.
ITR is required for applying for any loan in the future.
Banks require ITR even for applying for credit cards.
ITR is required for VISA applications, etc.

If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf.

The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date.

What is Advance Tax?


For salaried individuals, advance tax is mostly taken care of through TDS by employers. But other forms of income such as interest on savings bank accounts, fixed deposits, rental income, bonds, or capital gains increase the tax liability. One's tax liability needs to be estimated beforehand. If tax amounts to more than Rs.10,000/- per year, taxpayers need to pay advance tax in quarterly instalments (June, September, December and March).

Will I get a refund if I have paid excess tax?


Yes, any excess tax paid by you can be claimed as refund by filing your Income Tax Return. After your return is processed, ITD checks and accordingly accepts your refund claim, and then the amount is credited to your bank account. You will also get a message on your email ID registered on the e-Filing portal.

Here's a detailed list of exemptions and deductions available under the Old vs New Regime.

Old Tax Regime Vs New Tax Regime - Which is Better?
The new tax regime can largely benefit middle-class taxpayers who have a taxable income of up to Rs 15 lakh. The old regime is a better option for high-income earners.

The new income tax regime is beneficial for people who make low investments. As the new regime offers six lower-income tax slabs, anyone paying taxes without claiming tax deductions can benefit from paying a lower rate of tax under the new tax regime. For instance, the assessee having total income before deduction up to Rs 12 lakh will have higher tax liability under the old system if they have investments less than Rs. 3,12,500. Therefore, if you invest less in tax-saving schemes, go for the new regime.

That being said, if you already have in place a financial plan for wealth creation by making investments in tax-saving instruments; medical claims and life insurance; making payments of children’s tuition fees; payment of EMIs on education loan; buying a house with a home loan; and so on, the old regime helps you with higher tax deductions and lower tax outgo.

In light of the above and considering the new income tax regime, if taxpayers want to opt for the concessional tax rates, they may evaluate both regimes. Hence, it is advisable to do a comparative evaluation and analysis under both regimes and then choose the most beneficial one, as it may vary from person to person. Read a detailed breakdown on this topic here.

A company has to pay income tax irrespective of the level of income. The government passes laws prescribing the rate of taxation on your income from time to time.

How are taxes paid to the government?


You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return. If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf. If you are liable to pay advance tax, then you have to pay 90% of it before the 31st of March every financial year. You can file your ITR once the financial year ends.
The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date. It’s worthwhile noting that you attract a late filing fee of Rs.5,000 on failing to file ITR within the due date of the assessment year.

ITR stands for Income Tax Return. The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) releases all the ITR forms and specifies the procedures to be followed. This article provides an in-depth understanding of the definition of ITR and the types of ITR forms.

What is ITR?
Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form in which the taxpayers file information about their income earned and tax applicable, to the income tax department.

The department has notified 7 forms i.e. ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, ITR-4, ITR-5, ITR-6 & ITR-7 to date. Every taxpayer should file his ITR on or before the specified due date. The applicability of ITR forms varies depending on the sources of income of the taxpayer, the amount of the income earned and the category of the taxpayer like individuals, HUF, company, etc.

Which ITR should I file?
Why Should You File ITR?
If you want to claim an income tax refund from the department.
If you have earned from or have invested in foreign assets during the FY.
If you wish to apply for a visa or a loan
If the taxpayer is a company or a firm, irrespective of profit or loss.
If you have a loss from business/profession or under capital gains head, you will not be allowed to carry them forward to the next years unless you file the return before the due date.

Deposited more than Rs 1 crore in 'current' bank account: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have deposited a total of Rs. 1 crore or more in one or more current accounts with a bank.

The government introduced various incentives in the recent times to encourage the adoption of the new regime. 

These changes show that the government intends to have taxpayers transition to the new regime and eventually phase out the old one. Though the new regime is now the default tax regime, the old tax regime will continue to exist.

Budget 2025 Update
The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how!

The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows:

Current Tax Rates under New Tax Regime
New Tax Regime
A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D , and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in the Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes, which remain the same even for FY 2024-2025 since no changes were made in the Interim Budget 2024, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime. They are:

Higher Tax Rebate Limit: Full tax rebate on an income up to ₹7 lakhs is allowed. Whereas this threshold is ₹5 lakhs under the old tax regime. This means that taxpayers with an income of up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay any tax at all under the new tax regime! 
Streamlined Tax Slabs: The tax exemption limit is up-to ₹3 lakhs, and the new tax slabs are:

Salary income: The standard deduction of ₹50,000, which was only available under the old regime, has now been extended to the new tax regime as well. This amount has been increased to ₹75,000 for the new regime only with effect from FY 2024-25.
Family pension: Those receiving a family pension can claim a deduction of ₹15,000 or 1/3rd of the pension, whichever is lower. This amount has been increased to ₹25,000 for the new regime with effect from FY 2024-25.
Reduced Surcharge for High Net Worth Individuals: The surcharge rate on income over ₹5 crores has been reduced from 37% to 25%. This move will bring down their effective tax rate from 42.74% to 39%. 
Higher Leave Encashment Exemption: The exemption limit for non-government employees has been raised from ₹3 lakhs to ₹25 lakhs, an 8-fold increase.
Default Regime: Starting from FY 2023-24, the new income tax regime will be set as the default option. If you want to continue using the old regime, you must submit the income tax return along with Form 10-IEA before the due date. You will have the option to switch between the two regimes annually to check the tax benefits.
Old Tax Regime
The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime.

Difference Between Old Vs New Tax Regime: Which is Better for FY 2024-25?
The decision to switch to the new or remain in the old tax regime or which regime is better for you shall be based on the tax savings deductions and exemptions you are eligible for in the old tax regime. To make it easier, we have calculated a breakeven point for various income levels (refer to the table below) for a salaried individual below 60 years of age. This can be used to determine which regime to choose.

The Breakeven Threshold for Deciding Between New vs Old Tax Regimes for FY 2023-24
The Breakeven point is the amount at which there will be no difference in tax liability between the two tax regimes. 

If your total eligible deductions and exemptions in the old tax regime are higher than the breakeven threshold for your income level, it is advisable to stay in the old regime. On the other hand, if the breakeven threshold is higher, then moving to the new tax regime is more beneficial.

How to Choose Between Old and New Tax Regimes?
When deciding between the two tax regimes, it is important to take into account the tax exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime. After deducting all eligible exemptions and deductions, the net taxable income can be determined. By calculating the tax liability based on this net taxable income under the old tax regime, it becomes possible to compare it with the tax liability under the new tax regime.

Choosing the regime with the lower tax liability is the logical approach, and it is essential to inform the employer about this choice so that the appropriate Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) can be deducted from the salary.

If you have a loss from house property, capital gains, or business & profession, you need to consider them as well while making informed decisions on the selection of regime. Along with the current year's losses, even the previous year's losses eligible to set off will get lapsed as well. Ineligibility to carry forward such losses may impact your future income determination and taxes thereon.

Conclusion
Many individuals often find themselves questioning the disparities between the old and new tax regimes. The new income tax regime is designed to accommodate those who have more personal commitments such as repayment of personal/vehicle loans, medical treatment of parents or dependents, or wish to avoid the burden of extensive tax preparation or have minimal tax deductions due to their ineligibility for section 10 exemptions, standard deductions, tax on employment, employer contribution to pension scheme etc., Conversely, the old tax regime can yield more tax savings for senior citizens, who derive a substantial portion of their income from interest, can benefit from Section 80TTB, which allows them to claim Rs.50,000 as interest income deduction and feel more secure under the old tax regime.

Both the old and new tax regimes possess advantages and disadvantages. The previous tax structure encourages taxpayers to cultivate a habit of saving, while the new tax structure favours employees with lower earnings and investments, resulting in fewer deductions and exemptions. The new tax system is considered safer and simpler, involving fewer records and reducing the potential for tax evasion fraud. However, due to the unique nature of individual deductions and exemptions, a thorough comparison of the two regimes is necessary to determine the best fit for each person.

Interest
If you submit your return after the deadline, you will be liable to pay interest at a rate of 1% per month or part month on the unpaid tax amount as per Section 234A.

Late fee
In case of late filing, Section 234F imposes a late fee of Rs.5,000, which shall be reduced to Rs.1,000 if your total income is below Rs.5 lakh.

Loss Adjustment

What if ITR Filing is Missed?
Belated Return
If you miss the ITR filing due date, you can file a return after the due date, called a belated return. However, you will still have to pay the late fee and interest charges, and you will not be allowed to carry forward any losses for future adjustments. The last date for filing a belated return is 31st December of the assessment year (unless extended by the government). 

Updated Return
Still, if you miss the 31st December deadline due to unavoidable reasons still you can file the updated (ITR U) return subject to the conditions specified therein. Click here to know more.

What are Financial Year (FY) and Assessment Year (AY)?
The return you will file in the upcoming year is for the income you earned in FY 2024-25, i.e. for the income earned between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025. The assessment year is the review year for FY 2024-2025, where you file your returns and declare your returns by declaring all the incomes, exemptions, deductions, losses etc., already made or incurred during the year for tax assessment. For the income earned during the FY (here FY 2024-25), the assessment year would be the immediately next year, i.e. 1st April 2025 to 31st March 2026. Hence, the assessment year would be AY 2025-26.

An Income Tax Refund is issued by the Income Tax Department if a taxpayer has paid more income tax than was due for the financial year. Individuals/Businesses pay income tax through TDS deducted, advance tax on the basis of anticipated liability, or self-assessment tax which might exceed the actual tax liability. In some cases, an income tax refund can also arise in case the tax liability is reduced by claiming deductions, exemptions, set off of losses, or tax credits while filing the income tax return.

Post-filing, the Income Tax Authorities assess the taxpayer's tax liability. In case the tax liability assessed exceeds the amount paid, the excess tax paid is refunded to the taxpayer along with interest at 0.5% per month or part of the month (i.e. 6% per annum) until the date of refund.

How to Calculate the Income Tax Refund with Example?
If you paid more taxes than you were required to pay, you can claim the additional amount as an income tax refund.

Income Tax Refund = Total Taxes paid – Total tax liability 

If the taxes paid (either by way of Advance Tax or TDS or TCS or Self-Assessment Tax) are more than the actual tax amount due, then the excess tax paid can be claimed as a refund. The income tax department will recompute the taxes and validate the refund claim before initiating the refund.

For example: Assume Mr. Gupta paid 3 lakh as an advance tax during the financial year. At the end of the financial year, he learns his tax liability is only 2 lakh. He can request a refund by filing an income tax return (ITR). If the assessing officer approves his request, the excess tax amount of 1 lakh will be credited to Mr Gupta's pre-validated bank account.

3 lakh Advance Tax - 2 lakh Tax liability = 1 lakh Tax refund for Mr. Gupta 

The excess amount will be refunded along with interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of the month. If the refund is received in September, then interest of Rs. 3,000 (1,00,000*0.5%*6) will also be credited to the bank account.

How to Claim an Income Tax Refund?

To get your income tax refund or TDS refund, all you need to do is file your Income Tax Return and declare your income, deduction and tax paid details to the Income Tax Department. Once the ITR is processed successfully and if there is any excess tax, it will be issued in your prevalidated bank account. Follow the process and file your ITR via Cleartax.

Investment in a immovable property, predominantly house is one of the most sought-after investments primarily because you get to own a house. While others may invest with the intention of earning a profit upon selling the property in the future. It is important to note that a house property is regarded as a capital asset for income tax purposes. Consequently, any gain or loss incurred from the sale of an immovable property may be subject to tax under the 'Capital Gains' head. Similarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investments. We will delve into the chapter on ‘Capital gains’ in detail here.

What is Capital Gains Tax in India?
Any profit or gain that arises from the sale of a ‘capital asset’ is known as ‘income from capital gains’. Such capital gains are taxable in the year in which the transfer of the capital asset takes place. This is called capital gains tax. There are two types of Capital Gains: short-term capital gains(STCG) and long-term capital gains(LTCG).

Defining Capital Assets
Land, building, house property, vehicles, patents, trademarks, leasehold rights, machinery, and jewellery are a few examples of capital assets. This includes having rights in or in relation to an Indian company. It also includes the rights of management or control or any other legal right.

b. Personal goods such as clothes and furniture held for personal use

c. Agricultural land in rural(*) India

d. 6½% gold bonds (1977) or 7% gold bonds (1980) or National Defence gold bonds (1980) issued by the central government

e. Special bearer bonds (1991)

f. Gold deposit bond issued under the gold deposit scheme (1999) or deposit certificates issued under the Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 and Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2019 notified by the Central Government.

*Definition of rural area (effective from AY 2014-15) – Any area which is outside the jurisdiction of a municipality or cantonment board, having a population of 10,000 or more is considered a rural area. Also, it should not fall within a distance given below

> 10,00,000

 


Types of Capital Assets?
1. STCA ( Short-term capital asset ) An asset held for a period of 24 months or less is a short-term capital asset. So, if you sell the asset within a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a short-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the holding period is reduced to 24 months and 12 months. 

Some assets are considered short-term capital assets when these are held for 12 months or less. This rule is applicable if the date of transfer is after 10th July 2014 (irrespective of what the date of purchase is). These assets are:

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
2. LTCA ( Long-term capital asset ): An asset held for more than 24 months is a long-term capital asset. They will be classified as a long-term capital asset if held for more than 24 months as earlier. So, if you sell the asset after a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a long-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the applicable holding period is 12 months. 

Capital assets such as land, building and house property shall be considered as long-term capital asset if the owner holds it for a period of 24 months or more (from FY 2017-18).

Whereas, below-listed assets if held for a period of more than 12 months, shall be considered as long-term capital asset.

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
Note: Capital gains from the sale of units of a specified mutual fund acquired on or after April 1, 2023, and market-linked debentures will always be treated as short-term capital gains, regardless of how long they have been held.

Calculating Capital Gains
Capital gains are calculated differently for assets held for a longer period and for those held over a shorter period.

Terms You Need to Know:
Full value consideration: The consideration received or to be received by the seller as a result of transfer of his capital assets. Capital gains are chargeable to tax in the year of transfer, even if no consideration has been received.

Cost of acquisition: The value for which the capital asset was acquired by the seller.   
Cost of improvement: Expenses of a capital nature incurred in making any additions or alterations to the capital asset by the seller.

Note:

In certain cases where the capital asset becomes the property of the taxpayer otherwise than by an outright purchase by the taxpayer, the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement incurred by the previous owner would also be included.
Improvements made before April 1, 2001, is never taken into consideration.
How to Calculate Short-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Cost of acquisition
Cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54B/54D

Step 4: This amount is a short-term capital gain to be taxed

Short-term capital gain =	Full value consideration   
Less: Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer( for e.g. brokerage on sale)   
Less: Cost of acquisition   
Less: Cost of improvement
How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Indexed cost of acquisition
Indexed cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54, 54D, 54EC, 54F, and 54B 

Long-term capital gain=	Full value consideration   
Less : Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer   
Less: Indexed cost of acquisition   
Less: Indexed cost of improvement   
Less: Expenses that can be deducted from full value for consideration*
(*Expenses from sale proceeds from a capital asset, that wholly and directly relate to the sale or transfer of the capital asset are allowed to be deducted. These are the expenses which are necessary for the transfer to take place.)

Exception: 

Long-term capital gains on the sale of equity shares/ units of equity oriented fund, realised after 31st March 2018, will remain exempt up to Rs. 1.25 lakh per annum.
If the transfer happened on or before 23/07/2024, tax at @ 10% will be levied only on LTCG on shares/units of equity oriented fund exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh in one financial year without the benefit of indexation.
If the transfer happened after 23/07/2024, tax rate is 12.5%. Exemption of Rs. 1.25 Lakh available.
Deductible Expenses
A. Sale of house property: These expenses are deductible from the total sale price:

Brokerage or commission paid for securing a purchaser
Cost of stamp papers
Travelling expenses in connection with the transfer – these may be incurred after the transfer has been affected
Where property has been inherited, expenditure incurred with respect to procedures associated with the will and inheritance, obtaining succession certificate, costs of the executor, may also be allowed in some cases
B. Sale of shares: You may be allowed to deduct these expenses:

Broker’s commission related to the shares sold
STT or securities transaction tax is not allowed as a deductible expense
C. Where jewellery is sold: In case of sale of broker’s jewellery and where a broker’s services were involved in securing a buyer, the cost of these services can be deducted.

Note: The expenses deducted from the sale price of assets for calculating capital gains are not allowed as a deduction under any other head of income, and you can claim them only once.

Indexed Cost of Acquisition/Improvement
The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.   
Refer to this page for the complete list of CII.  

The indexed cost of acquisition is calculated as:

Indexed cost of   
acquisition =	(Cost of acquisition X   
CII of the year in which the asset is transferred ) /   
CII of the year in which the asset was first held by the seller or FY 2001-02, whichever is later   
 
The cost of acquisition of the assets acquired before 1st April 2001 should be actual cost or FMV as on 1st April 2001, as per taxpayer’s option.

The indexed cost of improvement is calculated as:

Indexed cost of improvement =	Cost of improvement x CII (year of asset transfer) / CII (year of asset improvement)
Note: Improvements made before 1st April 2001, should not be considered.

Note: The indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

Exemption on Capital Gains
Example: Manya bought a house in July 2004 for Rs.50 lakh, and the full value of consideration received in FY 2016-17 is Rs.1.8 crore.   
Capital asset type: Since this property has been held for over 2 years, this would be a long-term capital asset.

Cost of acquisition: The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken. Using the indexed cost of acquisition formula, the adjusted cost of the house is Rs 1.17 crore. (Refer CII here for the calculations)

Capital gain: Hence, the net capital gain is Rs 63, 00,000.

Tax: Long-term capital gains on sale of house property are taxed at 20%. For a net capital gain of Rs 63, 00,000, the total tax outgo will be Rs.12,97,800.

This is a significant amount of money to be paid out in taxes. This can be lowered by taking benefit of exemptions provided by the Income Tax Act on capital gains when profit from the sale is reinvested into buying another asset.

Section 54: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Purchase of Another House Property
Budget 2019 announcement!  

Capital gains exemption under Section 54: Taxpayers can get an exemption from long-term capital gain from the sale of house property by investing in up to two house properties against the earlier provision of one house property with same conditions. However, the capital gain on the sale of house property must not exceed Rs 2 crores.

The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).

The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on sale.

Conditions for availing this benefit:

The new property can be purchased either 1 year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property.
The gains can also be invested in the construction of a property, but construction must be completed within three years from the date of sale.
In the Budget for 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the capital gains to claim this exemption.
Please note that this exemption can be taken back if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase/completion of construction.
The capital gains tax exemption limit under Section 54 to 54F is restricted to Rs.10 crore. Earlier, there was no threshold.

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  then One residential house property should be purchased within 1 year before the date of sale of house property or 2 years after the date of sale of house property; (OR) Construct a house property within 3 years after the date of sale of house property.

Section 54F: Exemption on capital gains on sale of any asset other than a house property
Exemption under Section 54F is available when there are capital gains from the sale of a long-term asset other than a house property. You must invest the entire sale consideration and not only capital gain to buy a new residential house property to claim this exemption. Purchase the new property either one year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property. You can also use the gains to invest in the construction of a property. However, the construction must be completed within 3 years from the date of sale.

In Budget 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the sale consideration to claim this exemption. This exemption can be taken back, if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase. If the entire sale proceeds are invested towards the new house, the entire capital gain will be exempt from taxes if you meet the above-said conditions.

However, if you invest a portion of the sale proceeds, the capital gains exemption will be in the proportion of the invested amount to the sale price LTCG exemption = Capital gains x Cost of new house / Net consideration.

Section 54EC: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Reinvesting in specific bonds
Exemption is available under Section 54EC when capital gains from sale of the first property are reinvested into specific bonds.

If you are not keen to reinvest your profit from the sale of your first property into another one, then you can invest them in bonds for up to Rs. 50 lakhs issued by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
The money invested can be redeemed after 5 years, but they cannot be sold before the lapse of 5 years from the date of sale.
The homeowner has six month’s time to invest the profit in these bonds. But to be able to claim this exemption, you will have to invest before the tax filing deadline.
Section 54B: Exemption on Capital Gains From Transfer of Land Used for Agricultural Purpose
When you make short-term or long-term capital gains from transfer of land situated in Urban area used for agricultural purposes – by an individual or the individual’s parents or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) – for 2 years before the sale, exemption is available under Section 54B. The exempted amount is the investment in a new asset or capital gain, whichever is lower. You must reinvest into a new agricultural land (in urban or rural area) within 2 years from the date of transfer. 

The new agricultural land, which is purchased to claim capital gains exemption, should not be sold within a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase. In case you are not able to purchase agricultural land before the date of furnishing of your income tax return, the amount of capital gains must be deposited before the date of filing of return in the deposit account in any branch (except rural branch) of a public sector bank or IDBI Bank according to the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

Exemption can be claimed for the amount which is deposited. If the amount which was deposited as per Capital Gains Account Scheme was not used for the purchase of agricultural land, it shall be treated as capital gains of the year in which the period of 2 years from the date of sale of land expires.

Our handpicked plans can help you build a portfolio that is best suited to your financial goals and risk profile.

Section 54D: Capital Gains on transfer of  land and building which is used for  industrial undertaking 
Conditions to be fulfilled :

There must be compulsory purchase of land and building which is used for an industrial undertaking.
The land and building should have been used by the assessee for purposes of the business of the industrial undertaking in the 2 years before the date of transfer.
The assessee must purchase any other land or building or construct any building (for shifting or re-establishing the existing undertaking or setting up a new industrial undertaking) within 3 years from the date of transfer.
If such investment is not made before the date of filing of return of income, then the capital gain has to be deposited under the CGAS.
Amount of exemption :

If the cost of a new asset is more than or equal to the sale consideration, then the entire capital gain will be exempted.
If the cost of a new asset is lesser than Capital gains, capital gains to the extent of the cost of a new asset is exempt. i.e. the cost of a new asset will be exempted.
When can you invest in Capital Gains Account Scheme?
Finding a suitable seller, arranging the requisite funds and getting the paperwork in place for a new property is one time-consuming process. Fortunately, the Income Tax Department agrees with these limitations. If capital gains have not been invested until the due date of filing of return (usually 31 July) of the financial year in which the property is sold, the gains can be deposited in a PSU bank or other banks as per the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

This deposit can then be claimed as an exemption from capital gains, and no tax has to be paid on it. However, if the money is not invested, the deposit shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the year in which the specified period lapses.

Saving Tax on Sale of Agricultural Land
In some cases, capital gains made from the sale of agricultural land may be entirely exempt from income tax or it may not be taxed under the head capital gains. See below:

a. Agricultural land in a rural area in India is not considered a capital asset and therefore any gains from its sale are not chargeable to tax. For details on what defines an agricultural land in a rural area, see above.

b. Do you hold agricultural land as stock-in-trade? If you are into buying and selling land regularly or in the course of your business, in such a case, any gains from its sale are taxable under the head Business and Profession.

c. Capital gains on compensation received for compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land are tax exempt under Section 10(37) of the Income Tax Act.

If your agricultural land wasn’t sold in any of the above cases, you can seek exemption under Section 54B.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is the benefit of indexation available for computing capital gains arising on sale of a short-term capital asset?


Capital gains is determined by reducing the purchase price from the sale price. However, for an asset that has been held for a long time, it would not be appropriate to determine gains by merely reducing purchase price from sale price without giving any effect to the inflation. Hence, the concept of indexing the purchase price has been brought in. This way, the indexed purchase price can be reduced from sale price to determine gains. So, indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.

Should an NRI pay taxes on gains made on the sale of property in India?


Property sold in India is generally subject to tax deduction. The person buying the property must deduct taxes at the rate applicable to the NRI’s income slab, if the property is a short-term asset. If the property is a long-term asset, 20% LTCG tax is charged. Further, it is important for the NRI to ensure that taxes are deducted on the gains made and not on the sale proceeds. A jurisdictional Assessing Officer can help to determine the gains on which taxes should be deducted by the purchaser.

Can I set off my short-term capital loss against any other head of income?


First and foremost, capital losses can be set off only against capital gains. Accordingly, short-term capital losses can be set off against any income under capital gains be it short-term or long-term. However, long-term capital losses can be set off only against long-term capital gains.

What is the rate of tax on long-term capital gains on sale of house property?

While on the other hand, the indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

How to calculate income tax payable under new tax regime
For those salaried individuals who are continuing with the new tax regime for the current financial year, 2024-25, should know how to calculate income tax payable. It is important to remember that income tax slabs have been tweaked in new tax regime. Hence, knowing the correct way to calculate is important.

Further, for FY 2024-25, deductions available under new tax regime for a salaried individual have also been tweaked. A salaried individual can claim - i) Standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income instead of Rs 50,000 earlier, and ii) Section 80CCD (2) deduction for employer's contribution to employee's NPS account. This deduction can be claimed for up to 14% of the basic salary of an employee instead of 10% earlier.

Here is an example of how to calculate income tax payable under the new tax regime.

Suppose an individual's gross total income is Rs 20 lakh in FY 2024-25. He/she is eligible for standard deduction of Rs 75,000 in the current financial year and employer has deposited Rs 2 lakh in his/her Tier-I NPS account. This makes him eligible to claim deduction under section 80CCD (2) of the Income-tax Act.

Standard deduction from salary/pension
(75,000)
Deduction under section 80CCD (2)
(2,00,000)

Net taxable income
17,25,000

Hence, the net taxable income on which income tax payable is to be calculated will be Rs 17.25 lakh (Rs 20 lakh minus Rs 2.75 lakh).

Under the new income tax regime, income between 0 to Rs 3 lakh is exempted from tax. Hence, no tax will be payable on this income. After deducting income of Rs 3 lakh from Rs 17.25 lakh the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 14.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000. Thus, out of taxable income of Rs 14.25 lakh, Rs 4 lakh (Rs 7 lakh minus Rs 3 lakh) will be taxed at 5%. The tax payable here will be Rs 20,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 10.25 lakh (Rs 14.25 lakh minus Rs 4 lakh).

The next income tax slab is Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. Out of taxable income of Rs 10.25 lakh, the taxable income of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 10 lakh minus Rs 7 lakh) will be taxed at 10%. The tax payable here will be Rs 30,000. After this, the income left to be taxed will be Rs 7.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 10,00,001 and Rs 12,00,000. Out of the balance income of Rs 7.25 lakh, Rs 2 lakh will be taxed at 15%. The tax payable under this slab will be Rs 30,000. After this income left for chargeable under the tax will be Rs 5.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000. Here out of the taxable income of Rs 5.25 lakh, Rs 3 lakh (Rs 15 lakh minus Rs 12 lakh) will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable amount here will be Rs 60,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 2.25 lakh.

The final income tax slab is for incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The balance taxable income of Rs 2.25 lakh will be taxed at 30%. The tax payable here will be Rs 67,500.

The total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,07,500. In this tax amount, the cess at 4% will be added to this amount for final tax amount payable.

How to calculate income tax liability under old tax regime
The July budget 2024 has kept the income tax slabs under the old tax regime unchanged. If a salaried taxpayer opts for the old tax regime in the current financial year 2024-25, then one can claim various deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime (which is a default tax regime) does not allow claiming various deductions and exemptions except the specified two.

By claiming deductions such as Section 80C, Section 80D, HRA tax exemption etc. one can reduce their gross taxable income and thereby reducing income tax liability.

Remember, the income tax slabs under the old tax regime has different income tax slabs depending on the age of individual in a financial year.

Here is an example on how to calculate income tax payable under the old tax regime.

Suppose an individual aged below 60 years has a gross total income of Rs 17 lakh for the current financial year, i.e., FY 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). An individual has decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year. Further, he/she is eligible to claim following tax exemption and deductions - section 80C for up to Rs 1.5 lakh, section 80CCD(1b) for NPS investment of Rs 50,000, section 80D of Rs 25,000 for medical insurance premium paid and section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 on savings account interest earned.

(25,000)
Section 80TTA
(10,000)
Net taxable income
14,65,000

After deducting the deductions from the gross total income, one arrives at the net taxable income of Rs 14,65,000. The tax payable will be calculated on the net taxable income.

As per the income tax slab rates table, the first Rs 2.5 lakh from net taxable income will be exempted from tax. This is because there is no tax on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh as per current income tax slabs in the old tax regime. Post this, income left on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 12,15,000 (14,65,000-2,50,000). The second slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh which is taxed at Rs 5%. This means that out of Rs 12,15,000, then next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at 5%. The tax amount will be Rs 12,500.

Now the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 9,65,000. The third slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, taxed at 20%. This means that out Rs 9,65,000, Rs 5,00,000 will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable here will be Rs 1,00,000.

The balance income on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 4,65,000. The tax amount on this balance income (Rs 14,65,000 minus Rs 10,00,000) will be calculated on the basis of the last slab, i.e., above Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 30%. The tax payable amount comes out to be Rs 1,39,500.

Hence, the total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,52,000 (Rs 12,500 + 1,00,000+ 1,39,500).

Do note that cess and surcharge are also levied on the income tax payable. Cess is levied at the rate of 4% and surcharge is levied if the total income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From the example above, the cess amount is Rs 10,080. The surcharge will not be applicable as net taxable income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh. The final tax amount payable by individual is Rs 2,62,080.
How to know which income tax slab you fall in
Individuals, not having business incomes, are required to choose between the two tax regimes in every financial year. Furthermore, an individual needs to know the income tax slabs in which their income will fall. These two factors will help an individual to determine which income tax regime is more beneficial to them.

To know the income tax slabs and rates applicable to your income under any income tax regime, one must first know the taxable income on which tax has to be calculated. If an individual continues with old tax regime, then he/she is eligible to claim tax exemption (such as House Rent Allowance exemption, Leave Travel Allowance exemption, standard deduction) and deductions under sections 80C to 80U, as eligible for. After claiming and deducting the tax exemptions and deductions that an individual is eligible for, he/she arrives at the net taxable income on which income tax payable is calculated.

For example, your gross total income from all sources is Rs 12 lakh and you are eligible to claim deduction of Rs 2.10 lakh under sections 80C, 80TTA, 80CCD(1b). The taxable income on which you have to calculate tax will be Rs 9.9 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 2.10 lakh). Your income tax slab in the old tax regime will be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The tax rate is the 20%.

However, the income tax slabs and income tax rules under the new tax regime have been revised in the July budget 2024. From April 1, 2024, the new tax regime allows standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income and Section 80CCD (2) deduction up to 14% on basic salary for employer's contribution to the employee's Tier-I NPS account.

From the example above, after claiming deduction, the taxable income is, say, Rs 9.9 lakh (Gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh minus Rs 2.10 lakh). The net taxable income of Rs 9.9 lakh falls under the revised income tax slab of Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. This will be taxed at 10%.



Surcharge on income tax
The July budget 2024 has not made any changes in the surcharge rates applicable on the income tax amounts under the new and old tax regimes. If an individual's net taxable income exceeds a specified level, then a surcharge is levied. The surcharge is levied on the income tax payable amount before the levy of cess. According to income tax laws, a surcharge is applicable if an individual's taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From FY 2023-24, the government made changes in the surcharge rates under the new tax regime. The new surcharge rates have come into effect from April 1, 2023.

Surcharge rate from April 1, 2023 under new tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Up to Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore	25%

However, individuals opting for the old tax regime in current FY 2024-25 will continue to pay the surcharge rate they were paying in the previous financial years.

Surcharge rate under old tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Upto Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore but up to Rs 5 crore	25%
More than Rs 5 crore	37%

There are certain exceptions to the surcharge rates mentioned above. If an individual has earned income from capital gains (short term or long term) through the sale of equity shares and equity mutual funds or dividend income, the surcharge will not exceed 15%, irrespective of the income range.

While understanding the concept of surcharge, one must also know the term marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief kicks in when the amount of surcharge on income tax payable exceeds the increase in income over the specified limit.

Suppose an individual has a net taxable income of Rs 51 lakh. As the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, the surcharge will be applicable at the rate of 10%. The tax payable on Rs 51 lakh (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250.

Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where the concept of marginal relief kicks in.

To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is because no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500.

To ascertain the actual income tax payable with surcharge, compare the normal tax liability (before surcharge and cess) and tax liability after marginal tax relief (without cess). Normal tax liability is Rs 13,42,500 and tax liability after marginal tax relief is Rs 14,12,500. The surcharge that will be applicable is Rs 70,000 (Rs 14,12,500 - Rs 13,42,500).

The final tax payable amount will be Rs 13,42, 500 (Tax payable amount) + Rs 70,000 (Surcharge) + Rs 56,500 (Cess at 4% on Rs 14,12,500) = Rs 14,69,000.
Income tax slabs for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021-22 (AY 2022-23) FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24) under new tax regime
Effective from April 1, 2020 (FY 2020-21), an individual has an option to continue with the old tax regime (claim deductions and tax exemptions) or opt for the new tax regime without any deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime when announced was optional in nature and was offering lower tax rate as compared to the old tax regime. However, from FY 2023-24, the new tax regime has become default option. If no tax regime is chosen by the individual, then income tax payable will be calculated using new tax regime now.

Here are latest income tax slabs and rates applicable for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021- 22 (AY 2022-23) and FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24)

Why is income tax return filing important?


The income tax department has mandated to file the return to individuals only if their income is above basic exemption limit or if they meet certain criteria like expenditure on foreign travel being more than Rs.2 lakh, the electricity consumption of Rs.1 lakh or more, deposit an amount/aggregate of an amount above Rs.1 crore in one or more current accounts in FY 2019-20 or onwards.

ITR filing is also mandatory if business receipts exceed Rs.60 lakhs, professional receipts exceed Rs.10 lakhs and TDS and TCS amount exceeds Rs.25,000.

In the case of a resident whose asset is located outside India or who has signing authority for an account-based account outside India, It is always a good idea to file your ITR even if you are not eligible due to the benefits.

Filing of ITR creates a valid proof of income or net worth,
ITR is required for applying for any loan in the future
ITR is required by banks even for applying credit cards
ITR is required for VISA applications, etc.
ITR is required for obtaining Term insurance
ITR is required for obtaining government tenders
Hence it is advisable to file ITR even if your income is below the basic exemption limit.

What is income tax?



Income tax is a direct tax on your income. It means a portion of your income is paid to the government. The government employs this amount for expenditures related to health, education, providing subsidies to agriculture, infrastructure etc. It is paid by an individual/HUF/any taxpayer depending on income levels or gains in a financial year. A company has to pay income tax irrespective of the level of income. The government passes laws prescribing the rate of taxation on your income from time to time.

How do I pay income tax online?


Every individual can pay taxes Online or Offline. Please refer to this link for more details.

How are taxes paid to the government?


You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return. If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf. If you are liable to pay advance tax, then you have to pay 90% of it before the 31st of March every financial year. You can file your ITR once the financial year ends.
The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date. It’s worthwhile noting that you attract a late filing fee of Rs.5,000 on failing to file ITR within the due date of the assessment year.

How to save income tax?

However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime.

In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions.
In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).
In case of eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession, new tax regime is default regime. If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA.

If an assessee does not want to pay tax according to the New tax regime, he will have to explicitly opt out of it and choose to be taxed under the old tax regime.

However, to make the new tax regime more attractive, the tax rebate was increased to Rs 25,000 for New Tax regime only. This made zero tax payable for taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh in the new tax regime for FY 2023-24 (from April 1, 2023).

Note: NPS has a separate section 80CCD(1B) that allows an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit of section 80C.

ELSS (Equity-Linked Saving Scheme) Mutual Fund
Let us discuss further in detail the tax-saving investment options:-

The equity-linked Saving Scheme is a tax-saving investment option under Section 80C that has two features: First, the investment amount under the ELSS scheme is allowed for tax exemption up to the maximum limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. Second, the Equity-Linked Saving Scheme investment has a lock-in period of 3 years.

The annual return offered by the ELSS funds is approximately between 5%-18% (The interest rate offered by the ELSS funds is not fixed and depends on the market performance of the underlying equities). The returns received are not constant in an equity-linked saving scheme as they vary per the fund's market performance.

This tax-saving investment scheme offers liquidity and flexibility in investment and is best suited for those ready to take risks.

The returns received from ELSS are subject to long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) at 10% if the gain exceeds Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year. However, a top ELSS fund in one period need not be the best for the next period, too. The best ELSS fund should be selected for its performance across the bull and bear market phases.

Moreover, one can track one's investment in the ELSS online simply and hassle-free.

National Pension Scheme (NPS)
As per the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the National Pension Scheme is designed to help individuals save for retirement. National Pension Scheme (NPS) is for both government and private employees. Any age group from 18-70 years can participate in the NPS program.

NPS is a good tax-saving investment option, as fund management charges are pretty low. Fund management is done under four accounts in the NPS scheme: equity, corporate bonds, government securities, and alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in assets such as venture capital, private equity, real estate, etc. These accounts help investors manage their portfolios actively or passively.

There is a tax deduction of Rs. 1,50,000/- for self-contribution to NPS, which is covered under Section 80C. Under Section 80CCD(1B), an additional deduction of Rs. 50,000 is allowed against the contribution to NPS. Therefore, this scheme provides a tax benefit of up to Rs. 2 lakh.

Employer’s NPS Contribution is covered under section 80CCD(2) of the Income Tax Act.

Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)
Unit Linked Insurance Plan is the most versatile tax-saving investment option as it allows you to invest in debt, equity, or both, according to your requirement and risk appetite. Therefore, investing in insurance is beneficial in terms of both investment and saving.

Insurance provides financial security for the whole family and a tax-free lump sum amount on maturity. The premium paid towards purchasing a life insurance policy qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, the final amount received on maturity is tax-free as per Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act.

Public Provident Fund (PPF)
PPF is a very commonly heard term among taxpayers. PPF falls under the exempt tax status, hence the reason for its popularity. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office, but they can also be transferred from one branch to another or from post office to bank and vice versa.

The amount invested during the financial year for the PPF qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The interest and the maturity amount are exempt from tax under section 10 of the Income Tax Act. The PPF account lock-in tenure is 15 years.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is one of the essential tax-saving investment options. Launched under the government’s “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” campaign, SSY focuses on improving girl-child life. The scheme allows the taxpayer to deposit some amount in the account regularly and earn interest simultaneously. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana also qualifies for deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The minimum amount is Rs.250, and the scheme matures 21 years or till the girl child gets married, whichever is earlier after the account opening.

Interest accrues on the SSY Account, which gets compounded annually, is eligible for tax exemption under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

Maturity proceeds or any withdrawal amount is also exempt from tax under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

National Savings Certificate (NSC)
National Saving Certificate is a fixed-income investment scheme that is aimed at small- and middle-income investors. NSC is a good tax-saving investment option as the risk is low and is as secure as the provident fund. Moreover, the investment in NSC qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

The interest earned is also added back to the initial investment and is eligible for tax exemption.

The features of the NSC tax-saving investment option are as follows:

A guaranteed return of 6.8% annual interest.
A tax benefit of up to Rs. 1.5Lakh
Investment can be made as low as Rs. 1,000 (or multiples of Rs. 100)
The investor will receive the entire maturity value, which will be taxed to the taxpayer.
Senior Citizen Saving Scheme
As the name suggests, the Senior Citizen Saving scheme is available to senior citizens who are residents of India. This scheme offers one of the highest rates among the various saving schemes. Although this scheme's lock-in period is five years, the depositors can extend the maturity period by another three years. Moreover, the depositors can make investments with a minimum amount of Rs.1000 and multiples thereof.

The Senior Citizen Saving Scheme investment qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C. The interest on such deposits is taxable and liable for tax if the interest exceeds Rs. 50,000.

Bank FDs
Fixed deposits are considered one of the risk-free tax saving investment schemes. The bank decides the interest rate on a minimum lock-in period of five years. In the scenario of a joint account, the primary holder can avail of the benefit of tax deduction while calculating the taxable income. Additionally, senior citizens get the maximum benefits from a higher interest rate on investment. Premature withdrawal is not allowed in the tax-saver bank fixed deposits.

Investors can claim a maximum deduction of Rs. 1.5 Lakh by investing in a tax-saving FD A/c.

Interest earned from Saving Accounts Deposits under 80 TTA
All taxpayers can avail of a tax deduction on the interest generated from savings account deposits within limits. This interest can be from savings accounts in banks, post offices, or accounts in cooperative societies involved in the banking business. This tax-saving investment option is for ordinary taxpayers, not senior citizens.

The maximum deduction limit is Rs. 10,000 under this section, which includes the interest earned from all the savings accounts one has. Beyond this limit, any interest earned will be taxable.

Under Section 80TTB, the benefit of the least tax implication on interest income is provided for a senior citizen. Under this section, a deduction up to Rs. 50,000 or an amount from a particular income is allowed from the total gross income.

Interest paid toward the repayment of the Education Loan
Under Section 80E, students who take education loans to fulfill their education dreams are offered a tax exemption on the interest repayment. There is no cap on the deduction to be claimed. Tax deduction claims can be made from the start of the year when the payer starts paying the interest on the education loan and within the seven immediately subsequent financial years or until the interest is completely paid, whichever is earlier.

Premium paid toward the Health Insurance Policies or incurred medical expenses in case of senior citizens
The total taxable income towards the premium paid on Health insurance and expenses incurred towards healthcare is allowed for tax deductions under Section 80D. The limit to claim this deduction depends on the taxpayer’s family situation:-



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Eligibility                                                   | Exemption Limit                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Health insurance for self and family (spouse and children)    | Rs. 25,000                             |
| For self and family + parents                                 | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 25,000 = Rs. 50,000   |
| For self and family (below 60 years) + Parents above 60 years | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 75,000   |
| For self and family (with members above 60 years) +           | Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 |
| senior citizen parents                                        |                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interest Paid toward Home Loan
Under Section 24 (b), interest payments toward home loans can be claimed. The maximum limit that a taxpayer gets on the interest payment of a home loan is Rs. 2 lakhs if the house property is self-occupied.

Further, in those cases where the home loan taken for the property is not self-occupied but instead is rented, there is no limit on maximum tax deductions. A deduction can be taken on the whole interest amount.

Payouts on the maturity of the Life Insurance Plan
As per section 10(10D), all the incomes received from a life insurance plan upon maturity, surrender, or death of the policyholder are tax-free.

Exemption of House Rent paid (if mentioned in salary break-up)
If there is no HRA added to your salary break-up because you work in some small, medium-sized companies. In this case, you can claim deductions on the rent paid for furnished/unfurnished accommodation as per Section 80GG. The same rule applies to self-employed people, too. The conditions to claim the deductions are:-

Must not have received HRA during any part of the fiscal year
Should not be possessing any house in the city of occupation
Individuals should not own a house in the city of occupation in the name of spouse, minor child, or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) of which the person is a member.
Owning a house in any other city different from the occupation city is eligible for deductions, but it shouldn’t be self-occupied or left vacant.
The amount of deduction under this provision exempts up to the lowest value of the listed parameters:

The rent paid more than 10% of the total income
25% of the total income after adjustment
a maximum of ₹5,000 per month.
Hence, the maximum deduction allowed during the year is ₹60,000.

Deduction of House Rent paid (if not mentioned in salary break-up)
Under Section 10(13A) Income Tax Act offers tax benefits in the minimum value of the following:-

Actual annual rent allowance disbursed by the employer
50% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) if the house is situated in metro cities or 40% of the Basic Salary plus DA if the house is situated in other cities.
Actual rent paid for the house – 10% of basic pay plus DA.
In the above calculations, DA will be considered if it forms a part of retirement benefits.

Donations made to Charitable Institutions
Deductions can be claimed for the donations made to approved charitable institutions under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. The condition is that the donation should have been made by any mode other than cash, as cash donations exceeding Rs. 2,000 do not qualify as deductions.

Further, to claim this deduction, a taxpayer needs a stamped receipt from the institution they have made the donation, with details of the name of the trust, address, PAN Number of the Trust, the amount of donation, etc.

Donations to Scientific Research and Rural Development
Taxpayers can claim deductions under Section 80GGA for the donations made for scientific research and rural development. There is no cap, and 100% of the income spent is eligible for the deduction, provided the transaction is made via a bank account if the donation exceeds Rs. 10,000/-.

Donations to Political Parties
Under Section 80GGC, the entire income spent on the donation towards political parties is waived off from tax calculations, provided the transaction is made via a bank account. Also, the political party to which the donation is made must be registered under Section 29A of the Representation of People Act (RPA) of 1951.

Medical expenses for the disabled person
Under Section 80DD, individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) can claim deductions of the amount spent for the treatment and well-being of a disabled dependent family member. However, this claim is offered only to the legal family of such dependent individuals.

Based on the percentage of disability, if people have 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If people have disabilities, more than 80% can, they claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Flat Deduction for Disabled Person on the Basis of Severity of Disability
Under Section 80U, the disabled individual can claim tax deductions if a registered medical authority documents the disability with a minimum 40% impairment.

If the disabled individual has 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If individuals have disabilities of more than 80%, they can claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Individuals Diagnosed With Specific Diseases or Disability
Under Section 80DDB, individuals can claim exemptions on subsequent income spent on the treatment of dependent family members diagnosed with specific diseases. These critical illnesses include neurological disorders, AIDS, chronic renal disease, malignant cancers, and hematological ailments. For individuals below 60, a maximum of Rs. 40,000 is disbursed, and the same increases to Rs. 1 lakh for senior and super senior citizens.

Interest Earned on Deposits by Senior Citizens
Senior citizens take a heavy charge on their finances because of the expenditure on medical expenses. Relaxation from tax deductions helps senior citizens to simplify their lives. Under Section 80 TTB, senior citizens aged 60 years and above can claim Rs. 50,000 or a specified amount as a deduction from their gross total income for that fiscal year.

How to Plan your Tax Saving Investments for the Year?
Planning your tax-saving investments for the year requires strategic thinking to ensure you meet your financial goals while reducing your tax liability. Here's how to plan effectively:

Understand Your Tax Liability

Review your total taxable income and estimate the tax liability based on the applicable tax slab.
Identify areas where you can claim deductions or exemptions to reduce taxable income.
Choose the Right Investment Tools

Section 80C: Invest in options like PPF, ELSS, NSC, or Tax-saving FD, which offer up to ₹1.5 lakh in deductions.
National Pension Scheme (NPS): Contributions to NPS are eligible for additional deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) up to ₹50,000.
Health Insurance (Section 80D): Premiums paid for health insurance can give you deductions, which is beneficial for families and senior citizens.
Home Loan Repayment (Section 80C and 24B): Claim deductions on principal repayment and interest paid on home loans.
Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance

Select investments according to your risk appetite—ELSS funds for aggressive investors or PPF for a safer, long-term bet.
Consider mixing different investment types to balance growth and risk.
Plan for Long-Term Goals

Focus on long-term growth instruments such as NPS or PPF to not only save tax but also secure your retirement and long-term financial goals.
Avoid frequent withdrawal from tax-saving instruments to maximize growth.
Consider Tax-Free Income

Invest in tax-free instruments like the Public Provident Fund (PPF) or tax-free bonds that generate interest without adding to your tax burden.
Monitor and Adjust Your Portfolio

Regularly review your investments to make sure they align with your changing tax and financial needs.
Rebalance your portfolio annually, especially if tax-saving limits are reached or if tax laws change.
Make Investments Before the Deadline

Be mindful of the deadlines, typically before the end of the financial year (31st March), to claim deductions for the current year.

Features: Debt mutual funds invest in fixed-income securities and are suitable for conservative investors who seek moderate returns with lower risk compared to equity funds.

Returns: 8-10% per annum (subject to market conditions).
Features: NPS is designed for long-term retirement savings, providing tax benefits and pension income post-retirement.

Home Loan Tax Benefit - How To Save Income Tax On Your Home Loan?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

5 min read


If you are acquiring a home by taking a loan, then you can claim deductions on interest portion that you repay as a part of EMI, in accordance with the regulations of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 

While obtaining a housing loan can be costly, it is also possible to benefit from several tax deductions that can help you save money on taxes each year. It is important to understand how to maximize these benefits.

Home Loan Tax Benefit
Impact of New Tax Regime on Home Loan Benefits
Home Loan benefits under the old tax regime remain the same as one can avail deductions without any restrictions, however, the under new tax regime benefits are curtailed, let’s know in detail about the same

Deduction under section 80C for the payment towards principal component of the home loan, stamp duty, registration charges and Section 80EE, Section 80EEA are not available
Deduction under section 24(b) for the payment towards the interest component of the home loan is not available for self-occupied property.
However, deduction under section 24b is available for let-out property. If net income from let out property results in loss, then such loss will be allowed to set off against profit from another house property but not allowed to set off against other heads of income like salary or other sources.
Deduction for Interest Paid on Housing Loan under Section 24
A loan must be taken for the purchase or construction of a house property to claim a tax deduction. If it is taken for the construction of a house, then construction must be completed within five years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken.

The interest portion of the home loan EMI for the year can be claimed as a deduction from your total income up to a maximum of Rs 2 lakh under Section 24. 

From the assessment year 2018-19 onwards, the maximum deduction for interest paid on self-occupied house property is Rs 2 lakh.

For let out property, there is no upper limit for claiming tax exemption on interest, which means that you can claim deduction on the entire interest paid on your home loan. 

In case the construction exceeds the stipulated time, i.e. 5 years, you can claim deductions on interest of home loan only up to Rs 30,000 for the financial year.

ITR Filing Last Date 2024
The last date to file Income Tax Return (ITR) for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) without a late fee is 31st July 2024.

Deduction on Interest Paid Towards Home Loan During the Pre-Construction Period
Say you bought an under-construction property and have not moved in yet but you are paying the EMIs. In this case, your eligibility to claim interest on the home loan as a deduction begins only upon completion of construction or immediately if you buy a fully constructed property. 

So, does this mean you would not enjoy any tax benefits on the interest paid during the period falling between the borrowing of loan and completion of construction? Yes, it will be available but with some conditions and in future years.

Let’s understand how. 

The Income Tax Act allows you to claim a deduction for such interest, which is also called pre-construction interest. You are allowed to deduct it in five equal instalments starting from the year the property is acquired or construction is completed, over and above the deduction you are otherwise eligible to claim from your house property income. However, the maximum eligibility remains capped at Rs 2 lakh.

For example, you availed a home loan in April 2021 for construction and paid an interest of Rs 10,000 a month. Construction of the house was completed in April 2023 after two years. Hence, you can start claiming the pre-construction interest of Rs 2.4 lakh (approx) paid by you only after the construction gets completed in five equal instalments starting from the year 2023-24. Maximum interest deduction under Section 24(b) is capped at Rs 2 lakh (including current year interest + pre-construction interest). So if you paid interest of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year 2023-24 then you can claim a total interest deduction of Rs. 1,68,000 (i.e., Rs. 1,20,000 as current year interest and Rs. 48,000 as 1/5th installment of pre-construction interest).

Further, if your home loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80EEA, you can claim an additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh over and above the limit of Rs. 2 lakhs u/s 24(b). We have discussed Section 80EEA later in this article.

Deduction on Principal Repayment under Section 80C
The principal paid on the home loan EMI for the year is allowed as a deduction under section 80C. The maximum amount that can be claimed under this section is up to Rs 1.5 lakh.

But to claim this deduction, the house property should not be sold within five years of possession. Otherwise, the deduction claimed earlier will be added back to your income in the year of sale.

Deduction for Stamp Duty and Registration Charges under Section 80C
Besides claiming the deduction for principal repayment, a deduction for stamp duty and registration charges can also be claimed under Section 80C but within the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. 

However, it can be claimed only in the year these expenses are incurred.

Additional Deduction under Section 80EE
Additional deduction under Section 80EE is allowed to the home buyers for a maximum of up to Rs 50,000. To claim this deduction, the following conditions should be met:

The amount of loan taken should be Rs 35 lakh or less, and the property’s value shall not exceed Rs 50 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2017.
And on the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first-time house owner.
Additional Deduction under Section 80EEA
To promote the housing sector, Budget 2019 has introduced an additional deduction under Section 80EEA for homebuyers for a maximum of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. 

To claim this deduction, below mentioned conditions should be met:

The stamp value of the property does not exceed Rs 45 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022 (extended from 31 March 2021)
On the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first time home buyer.
The individual should not be eligible to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA if claiming a deduction under Section 80EE.
Deduction for Joint Home Loan
If the loan is taken jointly, each loan holder can claim a deduction for home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh each and principal repayment under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh each in their tax returns.

To claim this deduction, they should also be co-owners of the property taken on loan. So, a loan taken jointly with your family member can help you claim a larger tax benefit.

Loss under the Head House Property
If you have not let-out any of your house property then there are high chances that you might incur a loss under the head house property, reason being the interest deduction that you might avail u/s 24(b). Further, even if you have rented out the property, you can incur a loss under the head house property because there is no limit on interest on home loan deductions so your interest can exceed your rental income.

Further, even if you have rented out the property, you can incur a loss under the head house property because there is no limit on interest on home loan deductions so your interest can exceed your rental income.

However, in any of the cases the overall loss incurred during the year under the head ‘Income from House Property’ that can be set off against any other head of income is Rs 2 lakh only. If you have incurred a loss above Rs. 2 lakhs then you cannot set off such losses during the current year, but you are allowed to carry forward such losses for 8 years and claim the same against your income from house property in future years.

About NPS
NPS, or National Pension System, is a government-sponsored pension scheme available to both salaried and self-employed individuals. It offers dual benefit:

Tax savings during your working years
A regular income stream after retirement 
NPS is one of the most popular options for individuals seeking to create a retirement corpus and a regular monthly income. The money deposited in NPS is invested in various securities and investment avenues, including the equity market. It is widely regarded as one of the cheapest investment options with equity exposure. As the returns are directly related to the market performance, there is no guarantee of any particular amount. Still, over a period of time, returns from NPS have been among the highest in the market.

Two Types of NPS Accounts
There are two types of accounts in NPS, NPS Tier 1 and NPS Tier 2.

Tier 1 Account (Pension Account):This has a fixed lock-in period until the subscriber reaches the age of 60 years. Only partial withdrawal is allowed, with certain conditions. Contributions made towards Tier 1 are tax deductible and qualify for deductions under Section 80CCD(1) and Section 80CCD(1B). This means you can invest up to Rs. 2 lakhs in an NPS Tier 1 account and claim a deduction for the full amount, i.e. Rs. 1.50 lakh under Sec 80CCD(1) and Rs. 50,000/- under Section 80CCD(1B).
Tier 2 Account (Additional Account): This is a voluntary savings account that allows subscribers to make withdrawals as and when they like. Only the contributions made by a Central government employee to a Tier 2 account are eligible for tax deduction. To open a Tier 2 account, you must open a Tier 1 account first. The deposits made in the NPS Tier II accounts are eligible for an income tax deduction, under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, for government employees. On the other hand, there is no income tax deduction offered on NPS Tier II deposits for private-sector employees and the gains in the NPS Tier 2 are taxable at the respective slab rates.
Eligibility under Section 80CCD(1B)
An individual taxpayer is eligible to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(1B) by filing the income tax return under the old tax regime. 

However, there is an age restriction for opening an NPS account. The following individuals can open NPS:

Resident individuals between 18-70 years  
Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) aged between 18-70 years. However, if NRI’s citizenship changes after investing in NPS, the scheme will be terminated. 
How to Invest in NPS to Avail Tax Benefits?
Individuals can invest in NPS online or offline. NPS account can be opened online through the NSDL e-Gov portal, now known as protean. It can also be opened offline through a financial institution acting as a Point of Presence (POP). Most banks and non-banking financial companies are authorised to act as POPs. 

Things to Note while Claiming Deductions Under Section 80CCD(1B)
Here are some of the critical points about Section 80CCD(1B) that you should be aware of:

Individuals must file their taxes under the old tax regime, i.e., opting out of the applicability of sec 115BAC(1A).
The additional deduction of Rs. 50,000/- is available only for contributions made to NPS Tier 1 accounts
Tier 2 accounts are not eligible to claim the deduction under Section 80CCD(1B)
The deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) are available to salaried individuals as well as to self-employed individuals
You need to produce documentary evidence of the transaction related to the contribution to NPS
Partial withdrawals are allowed under NPS but are subject to specific terms and conditions
The total exemption limit under Section 80CCD(1B) is Rs. 50,000/- and is independent of exemptions under Section 80C. Thereby, you can claim a maximum deduction of  Rs. 2 lakhs
In case the assessee dies and the nominee decides to close the NPS account, then the amount received by the nominee is exempt from taxation
Documents Required to Claim Tax Benefit Under NPS

The following documents are required to be submitted while investing in NPS:

Bank account statement
PAN card
Aadhaar card
Taxation on NPS Withdrawal

If partial withdrawals are made from the account, then only 25% of the contribution made is exempt from taxation. If the assessee is an employee and decides to close the NPS account or opt out of NPS, then only 40% of the total amount is tax-exempt. The assessee can withdraw 60% of the entire amount upon reaching the age of 60 as tax-free income. The remaining 40% is also tax-free if it is used to purchase an annuity plan. 

Section 80CCD(1B) offers you an excellent opportunity to save a substantial amount on your taxation liabilities. This way, you can not only reduce your present tax liabilities but also work towards creating a substantial corpus for your retirement. Remember the points mentioned above, taking any action related to your NPS account regarding Section 80CCD(1B).

The purpose of the Public Provident Fund (PPF), which was first implemented in India in 1968, was to mobilise small contributions for investment and return. It can also be referred to as an investment vehicle that enables one to accumulate retirement funds while reducing yearly taxes. Anyone looking for a safe investment option to save taxes and earn guaranteed returns should open a PPF account.


How Important is PPF?
The PPF (Public Provident Fund) is considered an excellent investment option, especially for people uncomfortable with taking risks. While the returns may not be very high because they depend on the market, they offer stability. Additionally, investing in PPF can help diversify your portfolio and has tax benefits.


However, please note that to receive interest on your PPF investments, they must be made on or before the 5th of each month, as the interest is calculated on the lowest balance at the credit of account between the close of the fifth day and the end of the month. 

What is PPF Account?
PPF – Key Information
Interest Rate	7.1% per annum.
Minimum Investment Amount	Rs.500
Maximum Investment Amount	Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.
Tenure	15 years
Risk Profile	Offers guaranteed, risk-free returns
Tax Benefit	Up to Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C
Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a long-term investment option that offers an attractive rate of interest and returns on the amount invested.

Features of PPF account
Below are the essential features of PPF

Tenure: The PPF has a minimum tenure of 15 years, which can be extended in blocks of 5 years as per your wish.
Investment limits: PPF allows a minimum investment of Rs 500 and a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh for each financial year. Investments can be made in a lump sum or in a maximum of 12 instalments.
Opening balance: The account can be opened with just Rs 100 a month. Annual investments above Rs 1.5 lakh will not earn interest and will not be eligible for tax savings.
Deposit frequency: Deposits into a PPF account have to be made at least once every year for 15 years.
Mode of deposit: The deposit into a PPF account can be made either by way of cash, cheque, demand draft (DD) or through an online fund transfer.
Nomination: A PPF account holder can designate a nominee for his account either at the time of opening the account or subsequently.
Joint accounts: A PPF account can be held only in the name of one individual. Opening an account in joint names is not allowed.
Risk factor: Since PPF is backed by the Indian government, it offers guaranteed, risk-free returns as well as complete capital protection. The element of risk involved in holding a PPF account is minimal. As the returns from PPF accounts are fixed, they are used as a diversification tool for the investor’s portfolio. 
Tax benefit: The PPF interest and maturity amount are tax-free under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Partial withdrawal: PPF amount can be withdrawn partially from the 5th financial year onwards.
What is PPF Interest Rate?
The PPF interest rate for 2024-25 is 7.1% p.a., which is compounded annually. 
However, to receive the PPF interest for the deposit month, it is very important that you deposit your PPF amount within 5th of that month.


The Finance Ministry sets the interest rate every year, which is paid on 31st March. The interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the 5th day and the last day of every month. Thus, if you invest in PPF after the 5th day of the month, it will not be considered for interest calculation, and the balance which is there on the 5th day will be taken into consideration.

In a nutshell, the PPF contribution made on the 5th of a month will earn interest for that month, while any PPF contribution made after the 5th of the month will not earn interest and result in a loss of interest for that month.

Further, use our PPF calculator to figure out the returns you can expect on investing a certain amount in a PPF account.

Step 3: Submit the application to the concerned branch of the bank or post office where your PPF account lies. 

PPF Withdrawal Form
An individual must file Form 3/Form C for the withdrawal of the PPF amount. This form has 3 sections:

Section 1: Declaration section where you must give your PPF account number and the amount of money you propose to withdraw. Along with that, you also need to mention how many years have actually passed since the account was first opened. 

Section 2: Office use section which comprises details like:

Section 3: The bank details section asks for the details of the bank where the money is to be credited directly or the bank in whose favour the cheque or the demand draft is to be issued. It is also mandatory to enclose a copy of the PPF passbook along with this application. 

PPF Tax Benefits
PPF is one investment vehicle that falls under the Exempt-Exempt-Exempt (EEE) category. This, in other words, means that all deposits made in the PPF are deductible under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. However, it should be noted that the maximum contribution in PPF cannot exceed Rs.1.5 lakh in one financial year.

Furthermore, the accumulated amount and interest is also exempt from tax at the time of withdrawal. It is important to note that a PPF account cannot be closed before maturity.

A PPF account, however, can be transferred from one point of designation to another. But, do remember that a PPF account cannot be closed prematurely. Only in the case of the account holder’s demise can the nominee file for the closure of the account. 

Process to Close a PPF account
As per the rules governing PPF accounts, you can fully withdraw your PPF account balance only after the account completes its tenure of 15 years. Upon completion of the 15-year term, you can access the entire account balance, withdraw it fully, and close the account.

Any time before completing the full tenure of the account, you cannot withdraw the entire account balance under any circumstances. However, premature withdrawal of up to 50% of the account balance is allowed after completing 5 years. This is permitted under special circumstances only.

You can close a PPF account after completing 15 years from the date of opening the account. The procedure to close a PPF account in the post office is given below:

Step 1: Fill up the relevant information in Form C and attach your PPF passbook.

Step 2: Submit this to the relevant Post Office/bank branch where the account is held.

Step 3: Your application will be processed and the account will be closed. You will receive the payment in your savings account linked to the PPF account

Can you Close PPF Account Before Maturity?
PPF account can be closed 5 years after the account is opened in special circumstances such as life-threatening sickness faced by the account holder or dependents, paying for higher education or change in the residential status.

Process of Transfer of a PPF account
You can transfer your PPF account to another branch of the bank/post office, switch from bank to post office or switch from post office to a bank. Here is the procedure.

Step 1: Visit the bank or post office branch where your PPF account is held.

Step 2: Request the application form to transfer the PPF account and fill it up with the relevant details.

Step 3: The branch representative will process your application and forward it along with the certified copy of the account, nomination form, account opening application, specimen signature, and cheque/DD for the outstanding balance of the PPF account to the new branch.

Step 4: Once the new branch receives your application and supporting documents, you have to submit a new PPF account opening application along with the old PPF account’s passbook. You may change the nominee at this point.

Step 5: Once this application is processed, your PPF account is successfully transferred to the new branch.

PPF vs Mutual Funds
The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a savings scheme provided by the government, which offers guaranteed returns. However, there are other investment options available, such as mutual funds, that also offer tax-saving advantages. Mutual funds are investment vehicles that distribute funds among different types of assets, like stocks and bonds. They gather money from multiple investors and make strategic investments in securities.


Mutual funds have the potential to provide higher returns and greater liquidity compared to PPF. They are classified into different categories based on the asset class, such as equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. It's worth noting that only Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) among mutual funds are eligible for tax savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

Mutual funds have a proven history of delivering returns that have surpassed the market, making them a widely chosen investment option. Each category of mutual funds has its investment objective and level of risk.

Which is a Better Option: PPF or FD?
Public Provident Funds (PPF) and Fixed Deposits (FDs) provide guaranteed returns in the form of interest. However, there are significant differences between the two:

Tenure: FDs offer flexible tenures ranging from as short as 7 days to as long as 10 years, giving investors the freedom to select a duration that aligns with their preferences. On the contrary, PPF has a fixed tenure of 15 years, providing a stable and long-term savings option.

Taxation: PPF provides tax-free returns, while FDs are subject to taxation, including TDS.

Interest Rates: FD interest rates are determined by individual banks and can vary from one bank to another. Moreover, senior citizens often receive preferential treatment with higher interest rates on their FDs than regular citizens.

Loan Options: PPF allows for loans against the account, but the maximum loan amount is limited to 25% of the balance after 1 year. On the other hand, FDs also provide the option to take loans, allowing borrowers to access up to 90% of their deposit amount. The interest rate on an FD loan is usually 1-2 percentage points higher than the prevailing FD interest rate.

Loan Types: FDs can serve as collateral for different types of loans, such as home loans, business loans, and education loans, among others. The bank and the specific loan type determine the loan interest rate.

Is LIC better than Public Provident Fund?
There is often confusion regarding the difference between investment and insurance. Insurance protects against risks, while investment aims to secure a stable financial future. Investors must prioritise their financial well-being by maintaining an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses, obtaining insurance coverage for protection against accidents or unforeseen events, and saving for a secure future.

Having insurance is crucial for investors who have dependents relying on their income. There are different types of insurance schemes available, including term insurance, ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans), and endowment plans. However, it is advisable to prioritise a term insurance policy for adequate coverage and consider investing in a PPF for long-term savings.

A cost-effective approach to combining insurance and investment security is by opting for a term insurance policy along with a PPF. Rather than comparing the superiority of LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) and PPF, the emphasis should be on selecting an appropriate term policy that complements the PPF and meets your insurance needs.

Insurance plans with investment options like ULIPs can indeed have high expense ratios and hidden charges. Therefore, it is generally recommended to separate investment and insurance needs. Choosing a term insurance policy alongside investing in a PPF is a prudent strategy that allows individuals to enjoy the benefits of insurance and investment without unnecessary complexities. This approach ensures a clear and straightforward approach to meet both objectives effectively.

Public Provident Fund (PPF) Limitations
PPF accounts do have certain drawbacks that should be considered:

1. Lock-in Period: PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years, which is longer than other tax-saving investments like Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) with a lock-in period of just three years. This extended lock-in period can pose challenges in case of emergencies or when there is a need for funds during the investment period. As discussed earlier, premature withdrawals are allowed in PPF, but there are restrictions and regulations on when and how much you can withdraw. Therefore, it's important to ensure that you can commit to investing in a PPF account for 15 years.

2. Moderate Interest Rate: The interest rate offered on PPF accounts is not very high, especially considering it is a long-term investment scheme. In contrast, ELSS has the potential to provide double-digit returns to investors.

3. No Joint Holding: PPF accounts cannot be held jointly, which can be a limitation if you intend to open a joint account with your spouse or other family members.

4. Investment Limit: The maximum amount that can be invested in a PPF account in a year is ₹1.5 lakh. However, there is no limit to the amount you can invest in other tax-saving instruments like ELSS funds, NPS, or FDs, although the maximum tax benefit that can be claimed remains the same at ₹1.5 lacks under Section 80C.

5. NRI Restrictions: While resident Indians can open new PPF accounts, this option is unavailable for NRIs. If you had a PPF account as a resident Indian and have become an NRI, you can continue making deposits into the account, but you cannot open new PPF accounts.


6. Annual Contribution Requirement: PPF mandates a minimum annual contribution to keep the account active. Failing to contribute the minimum amount can lead to the account becoming inactive, and reactivating it requires paying a penalty.

Considering these drawbacks, it is important to carefully evaluate your financial goals and circumstances before investing in a PPF account.

Conclusion 
If you prefer low-risk investments and value the security provided by government-backed instruments, PPF can be a suitable choice.

Login
Login to your Cleartax account and click on ‘Start Filing’.

ITR filing page of ClearTax
Create an Account or Login with ClearTax
Create a new account or simply click on Login if you are already a user of ClearTax.

Create an account or Login
Link Your PAN
Linking your PAN allows us to submit your return to the income tax department. 

If you are filing with us for the first time, you need to link your PAN by entering your PAN, Date of Birth, and the OTP received on your registered mobile number. You can verify the OTP using either your 'Aadhaar registered mobile number' or ‘IT Department registered mobile number.’

Link your Pan to e-file
Pre-fill Your Personal Information
If you have previously filed with Cleartax and your PAN is already linked, you will directly see the autofill screen. To pre-fill your information from the income tax department, you will need to complete another OTP verification. This OTP verification is to capture all your personal information and income details in your income tax return with maximum security of your data.


If you choose the 'IT Department' option, you will need to enter two OTPs, one sent to your mobile number and the other to your email.

Too many OTPs can seem a lot of effort, but it is totally worth it! Most of your information will be auto-filled. This saves you nearly 2 hours of your time that would have been spent manually entering and correcting details. Review the auto-filled information and modify if necessary.

Pre-fill information
Upload Form 16
Scroll down and find the 'Upload Form 16' option. By uploading your Form 16, your salary details will be automatically captured. If you do not have Form 16, you can still proceed directly to e-filing by clicking on “Continue to e-file”. You can also upload multiple Form-16's if you have switched jobs in the Financial Year.

Form 16 upload
Form 16 successful

ClearTax will then automatically calculate your income along with the exemptions, deductions, etc., based on the details provided in FORM-16. You will now be redirected to this page, where you can see all your personal details, such as your name, address, bank details, etc.

Note: If you prefer skipping the pre-fill option, you can manually enter the details.

Here, you will see 4 tabs: Personal Info, Income Sources, Tax Saving and Tax Summary. 

Personal Information
All your personal details like name, address and other details will appear here. You can expand each section and review these details. You also have the option to edit them, if required. 

Personal Information 
Income Sources
Go to the ‘Income Sources’ tab. 

Salary
If you didn't upload Form 16 earlier, you can upload it here and fill in the salary details.

Salary Income
Rental Income or House property
Enter the income from house property, considering whether you occupy the house or have rented it out.

Income from House property
Capital gain
If you have sold assets like stocks, mutual funds, Gold, bonds, shares received as a part of ESOP or RSU scheme, land or building, then the profit/loss from such transactions must be reported under capital gains section. 

Capital gains

1. Stocks and Mutual Funds: 
Simply choose your stockbroker from the available options and log in to your investment account. Your capital gains will be calculated within seconds. Cleartax can effortlessly import and process thousands of transactions from your profit and loss (P&L) report to accurately determine the capital gains amount.
If you have done any intraday transactions, they will be automatically categorized as business income rather than capital gains. 
We don’t have the login option for some brokers yet, but you can directly drag and drop or upload the P&L report here. 
If your broker is not listed, you can download the excel template, fill in the required details, and upload the completed template.
For mutual funds, you should upload the P&L report from CAMS or Karvy by selecting their respective icons. You can also navigate to the "Mutual Funds" tab, where you will find CAMS, KARVY, and a few other brokers. Upload the P&L report here and your capital gains will be computed. If you have non-demat mutual funds, please upload files from both Karvy and CAMS. However, if you don't have the excel files or if your broker's name is not listed, you can manually add the details as well.
2. US or foreign stocks
A separate section is dedicated to reporting capital gain details from foreign stocks. Similar to stocks, you can either import the details directly from your broker. Currently, we support transactions from brokers like INDMoney and Vested. Even if your broker isn't mentioned, you can use our excel template to report all the transactions at once.

3. ESOPs and RSUs
If you have sold the shares received under ESOP or RSU scheme, you can add the following details under this section:

type of shares (that is, whether they are listed or not listed), 
date of purchase and sale and 
value of purchase-sale and brokerage expenses. 
Your capital gains will be calculated. 

Likewise, you can add details for all the other assets like Bonds, gold, land and buildings

Professional, Freelancing and Business Income
So broadly, there are 5 sub-sections here:

The first section is 44ADA- this is for professionals. 
The income tax law has specified a few professions and made it clear that only these professionals can opt for 44ADA: 
- Legal
- Medical
- Engineering
- Architecture
- Accountancy
- Technical Consultancy
- Interior Decoration
- Film Artists like cameraman, producer, editor, actor, director, singer, etc are specified.

Under the “Nature of Business”, you will find approximately 40 codes. Select the appropriate code. If you're unsure of the code, simply search for your profession. Also, mention the trade name and description. If you have multiple professions, you can include them all. 
The next condition here is that your revenue should be less than equal to 75 lakhs. If your revenue is more than 75 lakhs, you will have to file taxes normally and you will not be eligible to opt for the presumptive scheme. Revenue is nothing but the total amount you have received for the service offered. It is also called gross receipts. Some folks call it consultation fees. For example, if you are  a practicing lawyer and your clients pay you 1 lakh rupees towards a case, that 1 lakh would be considered as Revenue. 
The other condition is that your expenses cannot be more than 50% i.e. by default it is assumed that your expenses or cost will not be more than 50% of your income. Say your revenue is 20 lakhs, then your expenses has to be up to 10 lakhs. You can show a lower amount say 7 lakhs, then you’ll pay taxes on 13 lakhs but you cannot show a higher amount than 10 lakhs. Let’s add 12 lakhs. If you enter an incorrect amount, you will see error prompts immediately which will guide you whether you are eligible for the presumptive scheme or not. So there is no scope of mistake here.

You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.
Now let’s look at the second section, i.e. 44AD
44AD is mainly for small businesses say a private tutor, web designer, freelance content writer, small business owners. Just like there were some conditions under 44ADA, there are some conditions for 44AD too. 
- The first condition is that your turnover, i.e. nothing but your sales, must be less than 3 crores and 
- the second condition is that your profit must be more than or equal to 8% of your turnover. So if your revenue is say 1 crore, then your profit should be atleast 8 lakhs and you will have to pay taxes on this profit.
But if you have received the money through digital means, then you can pay taxes on only 6% profit instead of 8%. Even if you have received them through Phonepe or GooglePay, that would be considered as digital means. Here again, you will have to select the nature of business, trade name etc There are nearly 200 codes you can choose from.
Add the sales amount you’ve received through digital and non-digital modes separately here. The profit for digital transactions should be atleast 6% and for non-digital it should be atleast 8%. Now you can fill up the assets and liabilities details and proceed. 
There will be some freelancers who would be working independently and running unrelated small businesses too. So they can declare income under both 44AD and 44ADA, as long as the conditions are met.
If your revenue and expense conditions are not met, then you can fill in all the details under the third section. We will automatically select the correct ITR form for you, i.e. ITR-3.
You can add all your other business income here and fill up the Balance sheet and P&L
You have to fill all the Financial particulars if you have the presumptive income. You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why is income tax return filing important?

The income tax department has mandated to file the return to individuals only in case their income is above the basic exemption limit or if they meet specific criteria like expenditure on foreign travel is more than Rs 2 lakh and electricity consumption of Rs 1 lakh or more, deposits of an amount/aggregate of an amount above Rs 1 crore in one or more current accounts, and other conditions that the government will notify.

Later, the government provided additional conditions via a notification dated 21st April 2022. It has notified below conditions where the taxpayer is required to file ITR: 

Total business turnover/sales/gross receipts during the FY exceeds Rs 60 lakh.
Total gross receipts of the profession exceed Rs 10 lakh during the FY.
The aggregate of TDS and TCS during the FY is Rs 25000 or more (for senior citizens, there is an increased limit of Rs 50,000).
Total savings bank account deposits are Rs 50 lakh or more during the FY.
Other scenarios where it is mandatory to file ITR includes:

In the case of a resident whose asset is located outside India or has signing authority for an account based outside India. It is always good to file your ITR even if you are not eligible due to the benefits.

Filing of ITR creates a valid proof of income.
ITR is required for applying for any loan in the future.
Banks require ITR even for applying for credit cards.
ITR is required for VISA applications, etc.
Hence it is advisable to file ITR even if your income is below the basic exemption limit.
What is income tax?

Income tax is a direct tax on your income. It means a portion of your income is paid to the government. The government charges this amount for expenditures related to health, education, providing subsidies to agriculture, infrastructure etc. It is paid by an individual/HUF/any taxpayer depending on income levels or gains in a financial year.

How to pay income tax online?

You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return. If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf.

The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date.

What is Advance Tax?


For salaried individuals, advance tax is mostly taken care of through TDS by employers. But other forms of income such as interest on savings bank accounts, fixed deposits, rental income, bonds, or capital gains increase the tax liability. One's tax liability needs to be estimated beforehand. If tax amounts to more than Rs.10,000/- per year, taxpayers need to pay advance tax in quarterly instalments (June, September, December and March).

Will I get a refund if I have paid excess tax?


Yes, any excess tax paid by you can be claimed as refund by filing your Income Tax Return. After your return is processed, ITD checks and accordingly accepts your refund claim, and then the amount is credited to your bank account. You will also get a message on your email ID registered on the e-Filing portal.

Here's a detailed list of exemptions and deductions available under the Old vs New Regime.

Old Tax Regime Vs New Tax Regime - Which is Better?
The new tax regime can largely benefit middle-class taxpayers who have a taxable income of up to Rs 15 lakh. The old regime is a better option for high-income earners.

The new income tax regime is beneficial for people who make low investments. As the new regime offers six lower-income tax slabs, anyone paying taxes without claiming tax deductions can benefit from paying a lower rate of tax under the new tax regime. For instance, the assessee having total income before deduction up to Rs 12 lakh will have higher tax liability under the old system if they have investments less than Rs. 3,12,500. Therefore, if you invest less in tax-saving schemes, go for the new regime.

That being said, if you already have in place a financial plan for wealth creation by making investments in tax-saving instruments; medical claims and life insurance; making payments of children’s tuition fees; payment of EMIs on education loan; buying a house with a home loan; and so on, the old regime helps you with higher tax deductions and lower tax outgo.

In light of the above and considering the new income tax regime, if taxpayers want to opt for the concessional tax rates, they may evaluate both regimes. Hence, it is advisable to do a comparative evaluation and analysis under both regimes and then choose the most beneficial one, as it may vary from person to person. Read a detailed breakdown on this topic here.

ITR stands for Income Tax Return. The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) releases all the ITR forms and specifies the procedures to be followed. This article provides an in-depth understanding of the definition of ITR and the types of ITR forms.

What is ITR?
Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form in which the taxpayers file information about their income earned and tax applicable, to the income tax department.

The department has notified 7 forms i.e. ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, ITR-4, ITR-5, ITR-6 & ITR-7 to date. Every taxpayer should file his ITR on or before the specified due date. The applicability of ITR forms varies depending on the sources of income of the taxpayer, the amount of the income earned and the category of the taxpayer like individuals, HUF, company, etc.

The government introduced various incentives in the recent times to encourage the adoption of the new regime. 

These changes show that the government intends to have taxpayers transition to the new regime and eventually phase out the old one. Though the new regime is now the default tax regime, the old tax regime will continue to exist.

Budget 2025 Update

The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows:

Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000

5%

Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000

10%

Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000

15%

Rs. 16,00,001 - Rs. 20,00,000

Current Tax Rates under New Tax Regime
New Tax Regime
A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D , and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in the Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes, which remain the same even for FY 2024-2025 since no changes were made in the Interim Budget 2024, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime. They are:

Higher Tax Rebate Limit: Full tax rebate on an income up to ₹7 lakhs is allowed. Whereas this threshold is ₹5 lakhs under the old tax regime. This means that taxpayers with an income of up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay any tax at all under the new tax regime! 
Streamlined Tax Slabs: The tax exemption limit is up-to ₹3 lakhs, and the new tax slabs are:

Salary income: The standard deduction of ₹50,000, which was only available under the old regime, has now been extended to the new tax regime as well. This amount has been increased to ₹75,000 for the new regime only with effect from FY 2024-25.
Family pension: Those receiving a family pension can claim a deduction of ₹15,000 or 1/3rd of the pension, whichever is lower. This amount has been increased to ₹25,000 for the new regime with effect from FY 2024-25.
Reduced Surcharge for High Net Worth Individuals: The surcharge rate on income over ₹5 crores has been reduced from 37% to 25%. This move will bring down their effective tax rate from 42.74% to 39%. 
Higher Leave Encashment Exemption: The exemption limit for non-government employees has been raised from ₹3 lakhs to ₹25 lakhs, an 8-fold increase.
Default Regime: Starting from FY 2023-24, the new income tax regime will be set as the default option. If you want to continue using the old regime, you must submit the income tax return along with Form 10-IEA before the due date. You will have the option to switch between the two regimes annually to check the tax benefits.
Old Tax Regime
The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime.

Difference Between Old Vs New Tax Regime: Which is Better for FY 2024-25?
The decision to switch to the new or remain in the old tax regime or which regime is better for you shall be based on the tax savings deductions and exemptions you are eligible for in the old tax regime. To make it easier, we have calculated a breakeven point for various income levels (refer to the table below) for a salaried individual below 60 years of age. This can be used to determine which regime to choose.

The Breakeven Threshold for Deciding Between New vs Old Tax Regimes for FY 2023-24
The Breakeven point is the amount at which there will be no difference in tax liability between the two tax regimes. 

If your total eligible deductions and exemptions in the old tax regime are higher than the breakeven threshold for your income level, it is advisable to stay in the old regime. On the other hand, if the breakeven threshold is higher, then moving to the new tax regime is more beneficial.

How to Choose Between Old and New Tax Regimes?
When deciding between the two tax regimes, it is important to take into account the tax exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime. After deducting all eligible exemptions and deductions, the net taxable income can be determined. By calculating the tax liability based on this net taxable income under the old tax regime, it becomes possible to compare it with the tax liability under the new tax regime.

Choosing the regime with the lower tax liability is the logical approach, and it is essential to inform the employer about this choice so that the appropriate Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) can be deducted from the salary.

If you have a loss from house property, capital gains, or business & profession, you need to consider them as well while making informed decisions on the selection of regime. Along with the current year's losses, even the previous year's losses eligible to set off will get lapsed as well. Ineligibility to carry forward such losses may impact your future income determination and taxes thereon.

Conclusion
Many individuals often find themselves questioning the disparities between the old and new tax regimes. The new income tax regime is designed to accommodate those who have more personal commitments such as repayment of personal/vehicle loans, medical treatment of parents or dependents, or wish to avoid the burden of extensive tax preparation or have minimal tax deductions due to their ineligibility for section 10 exemptions, standard deductions, tax on employment, employer contribution to pension scheme etc., Conversely, the old tax regime can yield more tax savings for senior citizens, who derive a substantial portion of their income from interest, can benefit from Section 80TTB, which allows them to claim Rs.50,000 as interest income deduction and feel more secure under the old tax regime.

Both the old and new tax regimes possess advantages and disadvantages. The previous tax structure encourages taxpayers to cultivate a habit of saving, while the new tax structure favours employees with lower earnings and investments, resulting in fewer deductions and exemptions. The new tax system is considered safer and simpler, involving fewer records and reducing the potential for tax evasion fraud. However, due to the unique nature of individual deductions and exemptions, a thorough comparison of the two regimes is necessary to determine the best fit for each person.

Interest
If you submit your return after the deadline, you will be liable to pay interest at a rate of 1% per month or part month on the unpaid tax amount as per Section 234A.

Late fee

What if ITR Filing is Missed?
Belated Return
If you miss the ITR filing due date, you can file a return after the due date, called a belated return. However, you will still have to pay the late fee and interest charges, and you will not be allowed to carry forward any losses for future adjustments. The last date for filing a belated return is 31st December of the assessment year (unless extended by the government). 

Updated Return
Still, if you miss the 31st December deadline due to unavoidable reasons still you can file the updated (ITR U) return subject to the conditions specified therein. Click here to know more.

What are Financial Year (FY) and Assessment Year (AY)?
The return you will file in the upcoming year is for the income you earned in FY 2024-25, i.e. for the income earned between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025. The assessment year is the review year for FY 2024-2025, where you file your returns and declare your returns by declaring all the incomes, exemptions, deductions, losses etc., already made or incurred during the year for tax assessment. For the income earned during the FY (here FY 2024-25), the assessment year would be the immediately next year, i.e. 1st April 2025 to 31st March 2026. Hence, the assessment year would be AY 2025-26.

An Income Tax Refund is issued by the Income Tax Department if a taxpayer has paid more income tax than was due for the financial year. Individuals/Businesses pay income tax through TDS deducted, advance tax on the basis of anticipated liability, or self-assessment tax which might exceed the actual tax liability. In some cases, an income tax refund can also arise in case the tax liability is reduced by claiming deductions, exemptions, set off of losses, or tax credits while filing the income tax return.

Post-filing, the Income Tax Authorities assess the taxpayer's tax liability. In case the tax liability assessed exceeds the amount paid, the excess tax paid is refunded to the taxpayer along with interest at 0.5% per month or part of the month (i.e. 6% per annum) until the date of refund.

How to Calculate the Income Tax Refund with Example?
If you paid more taxes than you were required to pay, you can claim the additional amount as an income tax refund.

Income Tax Refund = Total Taxes paid – Total tax liability 

If the taxes paid (either by way of Advance Tax or TDS or TCS or Self-Assessment Tax) are more than the actual tax amount due, then the excess tax paid can be claimed as a refund. The income tax department will recompute the taxes and validate the refund claim before initiating the refund.

For example: Assume Mr. Gupta paid 3 lakh as an advance tax during the financial year. At the end of the financial year, he learns his tax liability is only 2 lakh. He can request a refund by filing an income tax return (ITR). If the assessing officer approves his request, the excess tax amount of 1 lakh will be credited to Mr Gupta's pre-validated bank account.

3 lakh Advance Tax - 2 lakh Tax liability = 1 lakh Tax refund for Mr. Gupta 

The excess amount will be refunded along with interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of the month. If the refund is received in September, then interest of Rs. 3,000 (1,00,000*0.5%*6) will also be credited to the bank account.

How to Claim an Income Tax Refund?

To get your income tax refund or TDS refund, all you need to do is file your Income Tax Return and declare your income, deduction and tax paid details to the Income Tax Department. Once the ITR is processed successfully and if there is any excess tax, it will be issued in your prevalidated bank account. Follow the process and file your ITR via Cleartax.

Investment in a immovable property, predominantly house is one of the most sought-after investments primarily because you get to own a house. While others may invest with the intention of earning a profit upon selling the property in the future. It is important to note that a house property is regarded as a capital asset for income tax purposes. Consequently, any gain or loss incurred from the sale of an immovable property may be subject to tax under the 'Capital Gains' head. Similarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investments. We will delve into the chapter on ‘Capital gains’ in detail here.

What is Capital Gains Tax in India?
Any profit or gain that arises from the sale of a ‘capital asset’ is known as ‘income from capital gains’. Such capital gains are taxable in the year in which the transfer of the capital asset takes place. This is called capital gains tax.

Types of Capital Assets?
1. STCA ( Short-term capital asset ) An asset held for a period of 24 months or less is a short-term capital asset. So, if you sell the asset within a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a short-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the holding period is reduced to 24 months and 12 months. 

Some assets are considered short-term capital assets when these are held for 12 months or less. This rule is applicable if the date of transfer is after 10th July 2014 (irrespective of what the date of purchase is). These assets are:

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
2. LTCA ( Long-term capital asset ): An asset held for more than 24 months is a long-term capital asset. They will be classified as a long-term capital asset if held for more than 24 months as earlier. So, if you sell the asset after a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a long-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the applicable holding period is 12 months. 

Capital assets such as land, building and house property shall be considered as long-term capital asset if the owner holds it for a period of 24 months or more (from FY 2017-18).

Whereas, below-listed assets if held for a period of more than 12 months, shall be considered as long-term capital asset.

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
Note: Capital gains from the sale of units of a specified mutual fund acquired on or after April 1, 2023, and market-linked debentures will always be treated as short-term capital gains, regardless of how long they have been held.

How Will Change in Income Tax Rules Affect Taxation on Debt Mutual Funds?
Here is calculation of the tax on debt funds before and after the investments as per the new regime:

Suppose Mr. Vinay invested Rs. 10,00,000 in FY 2018-19 in a debt mutual fund. He sold the investment after four years in FY 2024-25 for Rs. 18,00,000, resulting in a capital gain of Rs.8,00,000.

Calculating Capital Gains
Capital gains are calculated differently for assets held for a longer period and for those held over a shorter period.

Terms You Need to Know:
Full value consideration: The consideration received or to be received by the seller as a result of transfer of his capital assets. Capital gains are chargeable to tax in the year of transfer, even if no consideration has been received.

Cost of acquisition: The value for which the capital asset was acquired by the seller.   
Cost of improvement: Expenses of a capital nature incurred in making any additions or alterations to the capital asset by the seller.

Note:

In certain cases where the capital asset becomes the property of the taxpayer otherwise than by an outright purchase by the taxpayer, the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement incurred by the previous owner would also be included.
Improvements made before April 1, 2001, is never taken into consideration.
How to Calculate Short-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Cost of acquisition
Cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54B/54D

Step 4: This amount is a short-term capital gain to be taxed

Short-term capital gain =	Full value consideration   
Less: Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer( for e.g. brokerage on sale)   
Less: Cost of acquisition   
Less: Cost of improvement
How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Indexed cost of acquisition
Indexed cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54, 54D, 54EC, 54F, and 54B 

Long-term capital gain=	Full value consideration   
Less : Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer   
Less: Indexed cost of acquisition   
Less: Indexed cost of improvement   
Less: Expenses that can be deducted from full value for consideration*
(*Expenses from sale proceeds from a capital asset, that wholly and directly relate to the sale or transfer of the capital asset are allowed to be deducted. These are the expenses which are necessary for the transfer to take place.)

Exception: 

Long-term capital gains on the sale of equity shares/ units of equity oriented fund, realised after 31st March 2018, will remain exempt up to Rs. 1.25 lakh per annum.
If the transfer happened on or before 23/07/2024, tax at @ 10% will be levied only on LTCG on shares/units of equity oriented fund exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh in one financial year without the benefit of indexation.
If the transfer happened after 23/07/2024, tax rate is 12.5%. Exemption of Rs. 1.25 Lakh available.
Deductible Expenses
A. Sale of house property: These expenses are deductible from the total sale price:

Brokerage or commission paid for securing a purchaser
Cost of stamp papers
Travelling expenses in connection with the transfer – these may be incurred after the transfer has been affected
Where property has been inherited, expenditure incurred with respect to procedures associated with the will and inheritance, obtaining succession certificate, costs of the executor, may also be allowed in some cases
B. Sale of shares: You may be allowed to deduct these expenses:

Broker’s commission related to the shares sold
STT or securities transaction tax is not allowed as a deductible expense
C. Where jewellery is sold: In case of sale of broker’s jewellery and where a broker’s services were involved in securing a buyer, the cost of these services can be deducted.

Note: The expenses deducted from the sale price of assets for calculating capital gains are not allowed as a deduction under any other head of income, and you can claim them only once.

Indexed Cost of Acquisition/Improvement
The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.   
Refer to this page for the complete list of CII.  

The indexed cost of acquisition is calculated as:

Indexed cost of   
acquisition =	(Cost of acquisition X   
CII of the year in which the asset is transferred ) /   
CII of the year in which the asset was first held by the seller or FY 2001-02, whichever is later   
 
The cost of acquisition of the assets acquired before 1st April 2001 should be actual cost or FMV as on 1st April 2001, as per taxpayer’s option.

The indexed cost of improvement is calculated as:

Indexed cost of improvement =	Cost of improvement x CII (year of asset transfer) / CII (year of asset improvement)
Note: Improvements made before 1st April 2001, should not be considered.

Note: The indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

Exemption on Capital Gains
Example: Manya bought a house in July 2004 for Rs.50 lakh, and the full value of consideration received in FY 2016-17 is Rs.1.8 crore.   
Capital asset type: Since this property has been held for over 2 years, this would be a long-term capital asset.

Cost of acquisition: The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken. Using the indexed cost of acquisition formula, the adjusted cost of the house is Rs 1.17 crore. (Refer CII here for the calculations)

Capital gain: Hence, the net capital gain is Rs 63, 00,000.

Tax: Long-term capital gains on sale of house property are taxed at 20%. For a net capital gain of Rs 63, 00,000, the total tax outgo will be Rs.12,97,800.

This is a significant amount of money to be paid out in taxes. This can be lowered by taking benefit of exemptions provided by the Income Tax Act on capital gains when profit from the sale is reinvested into buying another asset.

Section 54: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Purchase of Another House Property
Budget 2019 announcement!  

Capital gains exemption under Section 54: Taxpayers can get an exemption from long-term capital gain from the sale of house property by investing in up to two house properties against the earlier provision of one house property with same conditions. However, the capital gain on the sale of house property must not exceed Rs 2 crores.

The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).

The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on sale.

Conditions for availing this benefit:

The new property can be purchased either 1 year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property.
The gains can also be invested in the construction of a property, but construction must be completed within three years from the date of sale.
In the Budget for 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the capital gains to claim this exemption.
Please note that this exemption can be taken back if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase/completion of construction.
The capital gains tax exemption limit under Section 54 to 54F is restricted to Rs.10 crore. Earlier, there was no threshold.

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  then One residential house property should be purchased within 1 year before the date of sale of house property or 2 years after the date of sale of house property; (OR) Construct a house property within 3 years after the date of sale of house property.

Section 54F: Exemption on capital gains on sale of any asset other than a house property
Exemption under Section 54F is available when there are capital gains from the sale of a long-term asset other than a house property. You must invest the entire sale consideration and not only capital gain to buy a new residential house property to claim this exemption. Purchase the new property either one year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property. You can also use the gains to invest in the construction of a property. However, the construction must be completed within 3 years from the date of sale.

In Budget 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the sale consideration to claim this exemption. This exemption can be taken back, if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase. If the entire sale proceeds are invested towards the new house, the entire capital gain will be exempt from taxes if you meet the above-said conditions.

However, if you invest a portion of the sale proceeds, the capital gains exemption will be in the proportion of the invested amount to the sale price LTCG exemption = Capital gains x Cost of new house / Net consideration.

Section 54EC: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Reinvesting in specific bonds
Exemption is available under Section 54EC when capital gains from sale of the first property are reinvested into specific bonds.

If you are not keen to reinvest your profit from the sale of your first property into another one, then you can invest them in bonds for up to Rs. 50 lakhs issued by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
The money invested can be redeemed after 5 years, but they cannot be sold before the lapse of 5 years from the date of sale.
The homeowner has six month’s time to invest the profit in these bonds. But to be able to claim this exemption, you will have to invest before the tax filing deadline.
Section 54B: Exemption on Capital Gains From Transfer of Land Used for Agricultural Purpose
When you make short-term or long-term capital gains from transfer of land situated in Urban area used for agricultural purposes – by an individual or the individual’s parents or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) – for 2 years before the sale, exemption is available under Section 54B. The exempted amount is the investment in a new asset or capital gain, whichever is lower. You must reinvest into a new agricultural land (in urban or rural area) within 2 years from the date of transfer. 

The new agricultural land, which is purchased to claim capital gains exemption, should not be sold within a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase. In case you are not able to purchase agricultural land before the date of furnishing of your income tax return, the amount of capital gains must be deposited before the date of filing of return in the deposit account in any branch (except rural branch) of a public sector bank or IDBI Bank according to the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

Exemption can be claimed for the amount which is deposited. If the amount which was deposited as per Capital Gains Account Scheme was not used for the purchase of agricultural land, it shall be treated as capital gains of the year in which the period of 2 years from the date of sale of land expires.

Our handpicked plans can help you build a portfolio that is best suited to your financial goals and risk profile.

Section 54D: Capital Gains on transfer of  land and building which is used for  industrial undertaking 
Conditions to be fulfilled :

There must be compulsory purchase of land and building which is used for an industrial undertaking.
The land and building should have been used by the assessee for purposes of the business of the industrial undertaking in the 2 years before the date of transfer.
The assessee must purchase any other land or building or construct any building (for shifting or re-establishing the existing undertaking or setting up a new industrial undertaking) within 3 years from the date of transfer.
If such investment is not made before the date of filing of return of income, then the capital gain has to be deposited under the CGAS.
Amount of exemption :

If the cost of a new asset is more than or equal to the sale consideration, then the entire capital gain will be exempted.
If the cost of a new asset is lesser than Capital gains, capital gains to the extent of the cost of a new asset is exempt. i.e. the cost of a new asset will be exempted.
When can you invest in Capital Gains Account Scheme?
Finding a suitable seller, arranging the requisite funds and getting the paperwork in place for a new property is one time-consuming process. Fortunately, the Income Tax Department agrees with these limitations. If capital gains have not been invested until the due date of filing of return (usually 31 July) of the financial year in which the property is sold, the gains can be deposited in a PSU bank or other banks as per the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

This deposit can then be claimed as an exemption from capital gains, and no tax has to be paid on it. However, if the money is not invested, the deposit shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the year in which the specified period lapses.

Saving Tax on Sale of Agricultural Land
In some cases, capital gains made from the sale of agricultural land may be entirely exempt from income tax or it may not be taxed under the head capital gains. See below:

a. Agricultural land in a rural area in India is not considered a capital asset and therefore any gains from its sale are not chargeable to tax. For details on what defines an agricultural land in a rural area, see above.

b. Do you hold agricultural land as stock-in-trade? If you are into buying and selling land regularly or in the course of your business, in such a case, any gains from its sale are taxable under the head Business and Profession.

c. Capital gains on compensation received for compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land are tax exempt under Section 10(37) of the Income Tax Act.

If your agricultural land wasn’t sold in any of the above cases, you can seek exemption under Section 54B.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is the benefit of indexation available for computing capital gains arising on sale of a short-term capital asset?


Capital gains is determined by reducing the purchase price from the sale price. However, for an asset that has been held for a long time, it would not be appropriate to determine gains by merely reducing purchase price from sale price without giving any effect to the inflation. Hence, the concept of indexing the purchase price has been brought in. This way, the indexed purchase price can be reduced from sale price to determine gains. So, indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.

Should an NRI pay taxes on gains made on the sale of property in India?


Property sold in India is generally subject to tax deduction. The person buying the property must deduct taxes at the rate applicable to the NRI’s income slab, if the property is a short-term asset. If the property is a long-term asset, 20% LTCG tax is charged. Further, it is important for the NRI to ensure that taxes are deducted on the gains made and not on the sale proceeds. A jurisdictional Assessing Officer can help to determine the gains on which taxes should be deducted by the purchaser.

Can I set off my short-term capital loss against any other head of income?


First and foremost, capital losses can be set off only against capital gains. Accordingly, short-term capital losses can be set off against any income under capital gains be it short-term or long-term. However, long-term capital losses can be set off only against long-term capital gains.

What is the rate of tax on long-term capital gains on sale of house property?

Long-term capital gains on sale of house property is taxable at the rate of 20% flat on the quantum of gains made. However according to Budget 2024,  The tax on long-term capital gains on other financial and non-financial assets is reduced from 20% to 12.5%. While on the other hand, the indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

How to calculate income tax payable under new tax regime
For those salaried individuals who are continuing with the new tax regime for the current financial year, 2024-25, should know how to calculate income tax payable. It is important to remember that income tax slabs have been tweaked in new tax regime. Hence, knowing the correct way to calculate is important.

Further, for FY 2024-25, deductions available under new tax regime for a salaried individual have also been tweaked. A salaried individual can claim - i) Standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income instead of Rs 50,000 earlier, and ii) Section 80CCD (2) deduction for employer's contribution to employee's NPS account. This deduction can be claimed for up to 14% of the basic salary of an employee instead of 10% earlier.

Here is an example of how to calculate income tax payable under the new tax regime.

Suppose an individual's gross total income is Rs 20 lakh in FY 2024-25. He/she is eligible for standard deduction of Rs 75,000 in the current financial year and employer has deposited Rs 2 lakh in his/her Tier-I NPS account. This makes him eligible to claim deduction under section 80CCD (2) of the Income-tax Act.

(2,00,000)

Net taxable income
17,25,000

Hence, the net taxable income on which income tax payable is to be calculated will be Rs 17.25 lakh (Rs 20 lakh minus Rs 2.75 lakh).

Under the new income tax regime, income between 0 to Rs 3 lakh is exempted from tax. Hence, no tax will be payable on this income. After deducting income of Rs 3 lakh from Rs 17.25 lakh the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 14.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000. Thus, out of taxable income of Rs 14.25 lakh, Rs 4 lakh (Rs 7 lakh minus Rs 3 lakh) will be taxed at 5%. The tax payable here will be Rs 20,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 10.25 lakh (Rs 14.25 lakh minus Rs 4 lakh).

The next income tax slab is Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. Out of taxable income of Rs 10.25 lakh, the taxable income of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 10 lakh minus Rs 7 lakh) will be taxed at 10%. The tax payable here will be Rs 30,000. After this, the income left to be taxed will be Rs 7.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 10,00,001 and Rs 12,00,000. Out of the balance income of Rs 7.25 lakh, Rs 2 lakh will be taxed at 15%. The tax payable under this slab will be Rs 30,000. After this income left for chargeable under the tax will be Rs 5.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000. Here out of the taxable income of Rs 5.25 lakh, Rs 3 lakh (Rs 15 lakh minus Rs 12 lakh) will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable amount here will be Rs 60,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 2.25 lakh.

The final income tax slab is for incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The balance taxable income of Rs 2.25 lakh will be taxed at 30%. The tax payable here will be Rs 67,500.

The total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,07,500. In this tax amount, the cess at 4% will be added to this amount for final tax amount payable.

How to calculate income tax liability under old tax regime
The July budget 2024 has kept the income tax slabs under the old tax regime unchanged. If a salaried taxpayer opts for the old tax regime in the current financial year 2024-25, then one can claim various deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime (which is a default tax regime) does not allow claiming various deductions and exemptions except the specified two.

By claiming deductions such as Section 80C, Section 80D, HRA tax exemption etc. one can reduce their gross taxable income and thereby reducing income tax liability.

Remember, the income tax slabs under the old tax regime has different income tax slabs depending on the age of individual in a financial year.

Here is an example on how to calculate income tax payable under the old tax regime.

Suppose an individual aged below 60 years has a gross total income of Rs 17 lakh for the current financial year, i.e., FY 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). An individual has decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year. Further, he/she is eligible to claim following tax exemption and deductions - section 80C for up to Rs 1.5 lakh, section 80CCD(1b) for NPS investment of Rs 50,000, section 80D of Rs 25,000 for medical insurance premium paid and section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 on savings account interest earned.

Net taxable income
14,65,000

After deducting the deductions from the gross total income, one arrives at the net taxable income of Rs 14,65,000. The tax payable will be calculated on the net taxable income.

As per the income tax slab rates table, the first Rs 2.5 lakh from net taxable income will be exempted from tax. This is because there is no tax on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh as per current income tax slabs in the old tax regime. Post this, income left on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 12,15,000 (14,65,000-2,50,000). The second slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh which is taxed at Rs 5%. This means that out of Rs 12,15,000, then next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at 5%. The tax amount will be Rs 12,500.

Now the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 9,65,000. The third slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, taxed at 20%. This means that out Rs 9,65,000, Rs 5,00,000 will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable here will be Rs 1,00,000.

The balance income on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 4,65,000. The tax amount on this balance income (Rs 14,65,000 minus Rs 10,00,000) will be calculated on the basis of the last slab, i.e., above Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 30%. The tax payable amount comes out to be Rs 1,39,500.

Hence, the total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,52,000 (Rs 12,500 + 1,00,000+ 1,39,500).

Do note that cess and surcharge are also levied on the income tax payable. Cess is levied at the rate of 4% and surcharge is levied if the total income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From the example above, the cess amount is Rs 10,080. The surcharge will not be applicable as net taxable income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh. The final tax amount payable by individual is Rs 2,62,080.
How to know which income tax slab you fall in
Individuals, not having business incomes, are required to choose between the two tax regimes in every financial year. Furthermore, an individual needs to know the income tax slabs in which their income will fall. These two factors will help an individual to determine which income tax regime is more beneficial to them.

To know the income tax slabs and rates applicable to your income under any income tax regime, one must first know the taxable income on which tax has to be calculated. If an individual continues with old tax regime, then he/she is eligible to claim tax exemption (such as House Rent Allowance exemption, Leave Travel Allowance exemption, standard deduction) and deductions under sections 80C to 80U, as eligible for. After claiming and deducting the tax exemptions and deductions that an individual is eligible for, he/she arrives at the net taxable income on which income tax payable is calculated.

For example, your gross total income from all sources is Rs 12 lakh and you are eligible to claim deduction of Rs 2.10 lakh under sections 80C, 80TTA, 80CCD(1b). The taxable income on which you have to calculate tax will be Rs 9.9 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 2.10 lakh). Your income tax slab in the old tax regime will be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The tax rate is the 20%.

However, the income tax slabs and income tax rules under the new tax regime have been revised in the July budget 2024. From April 1, 2024, the new tax regime allows standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income and Section 80CCD (2) deduction up to 14% on basic salary for employer's contribution to the employee's Tier-I NPS account.

From the example above, after claiming deduction, the taxable income is, say, Rs 9.9 lakh (Gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh minus Rs 2.10 lakh). The net taxable income of Rs 9.9 lakh falls under the revised income tax slab of Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. This will be taxed at 10%.



Surcharge on income tax
The July budget 2024 has not made any changes in the surcharge rates applicable on the income tax amounts under the new and old tax regimes. If an individual's net taxable income exceeds a specified level, then a surcharge is levied. The surcharge is levied on the income tax payable amount before the levy of cess. According to income tax laws, a surcharge is applicable if an individual's taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From FY 2023-24, the government made changes in the surcharge rates under the new tax regime. The new surcharge rates have come into effect from April 1, 2023.

Surcharge rate from April 1, 2023 under new tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Up to Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore	25%

However, individuals opting for the old tax regime in current FY 2024-25 will continue to pay the surcharge rate they were paying in the previous financial years.

Surcharge rate under old tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Upto Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore but up to Rs 5 crore	25%
More than Rs 5 crore	37%

There are certain exceptions to the surcharge rates mentioned above. If an individual has earned income from capital gains (short term or long term) through the sale of equity shares and equity mutual funds or dividend income, the surcharge will not exceed 15%, irrespective of the income range.

While understanding the concept of surcharge, one must also know the term marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief kicks in when the amount of surcharge on income tax payable exceeds the increase in income over the specified limit.

Suppose an individual has a net taxable income of Rs 51 lakh. As the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, the surcharge will be applicable at the rate of 10%. The tax payable on Rs 51 lakh (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250.

Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where the concept of marginal relief kicks in.

To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is because no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500.

To ascertain the actual income tax payable with surcharge, compare the normal tax liability (before surcharge and cess) and tax liability after marginal tax relief (without cess). Normal tax liability is Rs 13,42,500 and tax liability after marginal tax relief is Rs 14,12,500. The surcharge that will be applicable is Rs 70,000 (Rs 14,12,500 - Rs 13,42,500).

The final tax payable amount will be Rs 13,42, 500 (Tax payable amount) + Rs 70,000 (Surcharge) + Rs 56,500 (Cess at 4% on Rs 14,12,500) = Rs 14,69,000.
Income tax slabs for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021-22 (AY 2022-23) FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24) under new tax regime
Effective from April 1, 2020 (FY 2020-21), an individual has an option to continue with the old tax regime (claim deductions and tax exemptions) or opt for the new tax regime without any deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime when announced was optional in nature and was offering lower tax rate as compared to the old tax regime. However, from FY 2023-24, the new tax regime has become default option. If no tax regime is chosen by the individual, then income tax payable will be calculated using new tax regime now.

Here are latest income tax slabs and rates applicable for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021- 22 (AY 2022-23) and FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24)

What is income tax?



Income tax is a direct tax on your income. It means a portion of your income is paid to the government. The government employs this amount for expenditures related to health, education, providing subsidies to agriculture, infrastructure etc. It is paid by an individual/HUF/any taxpayer depending on income levels or gains in a financial year.

Note: NPS has a separate section 80CCD(1B) that allows an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit of section 80C.

ELSS (Equity-Linked Saving Scheme) Mutual Fund
Let us discuss further in detail the tax-saving investment options:-

The equity-linked Saving Scheme is a tax-saving investment option under Section 80C that has two features: First, the investment amount under the ELSS scheme is allowed for tax exemption up to the maximum limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. Second, the Equity-Linked Saving Scheme investment has a lock-in period of 3 years.

The annual return offered by the ELSS funds is approximately between 5%-18% (The interest rate offered by the ELSS funds is not fixed and depends on the market performance of the underlying equities). The returns received are not constant in an equity-linked saving scheme as they vary per the fund's market performance.

This tax-saving investment scheme offers liquidity and flexibility in investment and is best suited for those ready to take risks.

The returns received from ELSS are subject to long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) at 10% if the gain exceeds Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year. However, a top ELSS fund in one period need not be the best for the next period, too. The best ELSS fund should be selected for its performance across the bull and bear market phases.

Moreover, one can track one's investment in the ELSS online simply and hassle-free.

National Pension Scheme (NPS)
As per the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the National Pension Scheme is designed to help individuals save for retirement. National Pension Scheme (NPS) is for both government and private employees. Any age group from 18-70 years can participate in the NPS program.

NPS is a good tax-saving investment option, as fund management charges are pretty low. Fund management is done under four accounts in the NPS scheme: equity, corporate bonds, government securities, and alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in assets such as venture capital, private equity, real estate, etc. These accounts help investors manage their portfolios actively or passively.

There is a tax deduction of Rs. 1,50,000/- for self-contribution to NPS, which is covered under Section 80C. Under Section 80CCD(1B), an additional deduction of Rs. 50,000 is allowed against the contribution to NPS. Therefore, this scheme provides a tax benefit of up to Rs. 2 lakh.

Employer’s NPS Contribution is covered under section 80CCD(2) of the Income Tax Act.

Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)
Unit Linked Insurance Plan is the most versatile tax-saving investment option as it allows you to invest in debt, equity, or both, according to your requirement and risk appetite. Therefore, investing in insurance is beneficial in terms of both investment and saving.

Insurance provides financial security for the whole family and a tax-free lump sum amount on maturity. The premium paid towards purchasing a life insurance policy qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, the final amount received on maturity is tax-free as per Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act.

Public Provident Fund (PPF)
PPF is a very commonly heard term among taxpayers. PPF falls under the exempt tax status, hence the reason for its popularity. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office, but they can also be transferred from one branch to another or from post office to bank and vice versa.

The amount invested during the financial year for the PPF qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The interest and the maturity amount are exempt from tax under section 10 of the Income Tax Act. The PPF account lock-in tenure is 15 years.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)

Interest earned from Saving Accounts Deposits under 80 TTA
All taxpayers can avail of a tax deduction on the interest generated from savings account deposits within limits. This interest can be from savings accounts in banks, post offices, or accounts in cooperative societies involved in the banking business. This tax-saving investment option is for ordinary taxpayers, not senior citizens.

The maximum deduction limit is Rs. 10,000 under this section, which includes the interest earned from all the savings accounts one has. Beyond this limit, any interest earned will be taxable.

Under Section 80TTB, the benefit of the least tax implication on interest income is provided for a senior citizen. Under this section, a deduction up to Rs. 50,000 or an amount from a particular income is allowed from the total gross income.

Interest paid toward the repayment of the Education Loan
Under Section 80E, students who take education loans to fulfill their education dreams are offered a tax exemption on the interest repayment. There is no cap on the deduction to be claimed. Tax deduction claims can be made from the start of the year when the payer starts paying the interest on the education loan and within the seven immediately subsequent financial years or until the interest is completely paid, whichever is earlier.

Premium paid toward the Health Insurance Policies or incurred medical expenses in case of senior citizens
The total taxable income towards the premium paid on Health insurance and expenses incurred towards healthcare is allowed for tax deductions under Section 80D. The limit to claim this deduction depends on the taxpayer’s family situation:-



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Eligibility                                                   | Exemption Limit                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Health insurance for self and family (spouse and children)    | Rs. 25,000                             |
| For self and family + parents                                 | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 25,000 = Rs. 50,000   |
| For self and family (below 60 years) + Parents above 60 years | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 75,000   |
| For self and family (with members above 60 years) +           | Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 |
| senior citizen parents                                        |                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interest Paid toward Home Loan
Under Section 24 (b), interest payments toward home loans can be claimed. The maximum limit that a taxpayer gets on the interest payment of a home loan is Rs. 2 lakhs if the house property is self-occupied.

Further, in those cases where the home loan taken for the property is not self-occupied but instead is rented, there is no limit on maximum tax deductions. A deduction can be taken on the whole interest amount.

Payouts on the maturity of the Life Insurance Plan
As per section 10(10D), all the incomes received from a life insurance plan upon maturity, surrender, or death of the policyholder are tax-free.

Exemption of House Rent paid (if mentioned in salary break-up)
If there is no HRA added to your salary break-up because you work in some small, medium-sized companies. In this case, you can claim deductions on the rent paid for furnished/unfurnished accommodation as per Section 80GG. The same rule applies to self-employed people, too. The conditions to claim the deductions are:-

Must not have received HRA during any part of the fiscal year
Should not be possessing any house in the city of occupation
Individuals should not own a house in the city of occupation in the name of spouse, minor child, or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) of which the person is a member.
Owning a house in any other city different from the occupation city is eligible for deductions, but it shouldn’t be self-occupied or left vacant.
The amount of deduction under this provision exempts up to the lowest value of the listed parameters:

The rent paid more than 10% of the total income
25% of the total income after adjustment
a maximum of ₹5,000 per month.
Hence, the maximum deduction allowed during the year is ₹60,000.

Deduction of House Rent paid (if not mentioned in salary break-up)
Under Section 10(13A) Income Tax Act offers tax benefits in the minimum value of the following:-

Actual annual rent allowance disbursed by the employer
50% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) if the house is situated in metro cities or 40% of the Basic Salary plus DA if the house is situated in other cities.
Actual rent paid for the house – 10% of basic pay plus DA.
In the above calculations, DA will be considered if it forms a part of retirement benefits.

Donations made to Charitable Institutions
Deductions can be claimed for the donations made to approved charitable institutions under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. The condition is that the donation should have been made by any mode other than cash, as cash donations exceeding Rs. 2,000 do not qualify as deductions.

Further, to claim this deduction, a taxpayer needs a stamped receipt from the institution they have made the donation, with details of the name of the trust, address, PAN Number of the Trust, the amount of donation, etc.

Donations to Scientific Research and Rural Development
Taxpayers can claim deductions under Section 80GGA for the donations made for scientific research and rural development. There is no cap, and 100% of the income spent is eligible for the deduction, provided the transaction is made via a bank account if the donation exceeds Rs. 10,000/-.

Donations to Political Parties
Under Section 80GGC, the entire income spent on the donation towards political parties is waived off from tax calculations, provided the transaction is made via a bank account. Also, the political party to which the donation is made must be registered under Section 29A of the Representation of People Act (RPA) of 1951.

Medical expenses for the disabled person
Under Section 80DD, individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) can claim deductions of the amount spent for the treatment and well-being of a disabled dependent family member. However, this claim is offered only to the legal family of such dependent individuals.

Based on the percentage of disability, if people have 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If people have disabilities, more than 80% can, they claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Flat Deduction for Disabled Person on the Basis of Severity of Disability
Under Section 80U, the disabled individual can claim tax deductions if a registered medical authority documents the disability with a minimum 40% impairment.

If the disabled individual has 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If individuals have disabilities of more than 80%, they can claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Individuals Diagnosed With Specific Diseases or Disability
Under Section 80DDB, individuals can claim exemptions on subsequent income spent on the treatment of dependent family members diagnosed with specific diseases. These critical illnesses include neurological disorders, AIDS, chronic renal disease, malignant cancers, and hematological ailments. For individuals below 60, a maximum of Rs. 40,000 is disbursed, and the same increases to Rs. 1 lakh for senior and super senior citizens.

Interest Earned on Deposits by Senior Citizens
Senior citizens take a heavy charge on their finances because of the expenditure on medical expenses. Relaxation from tax deductions helps senior citizens to simplify their lives. Under Section 80 TTB, senior citizens aged 60 years and above can claim Rs. 50,000 or a specified amount as a deduction from their gross total income for that fiscal year.

How to Plan your Tax Saving Investments for the Year?
Planning your tax-saving investments for the year requires strategic thinking to ensure you meet your financial goals while reducing your tax liability. Here's how to plan effectively:

Understand Your Tax Liability

Review your total taxable income and estimate the tax liability based on the applicable tax slab.
Identify areas where you can claim deductions or exemptions to reduce taxable income.
Choose the Right Investment Tools

Section 80C: Invest in options like PPF, ELSS, NSC, or Tax-saving FD, which offer up to ₹1.5 lakh in deductions.
National Pension Scheme (NPS): Contributions to NPS are eligible for additional deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) up to ₹50,000.
Health Insurance (Section 80D): Premiums paid for health insurance can give you deductions, which is beneficial for families and senior citizens.
Home Loan Repayment (Section 80C and 24B): Claim deductions on principal repayment and interest paid on home loans.
Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance

Select investments according to your risk appetite—ELSS funds for aggressive investors or PPF for a safer, long-term bet.
Consider mixing different investment types to balance growth and risk.
Plan for Long-Term Goals

Focus on long-term growth instruments such as NPS or PPF to not only save tax but also secure your retirement and long-term financial goals.
Avoid frequent withdrawal from tax-saving instruments to maximize growth.
Consider Tax-Free Income

Invest in tax-free instruments like the Public Provident Fund (PPF) or tax-free bonds that generate interest without adding to your tax burden.
Monitor and Adjust Your Portfolio

Regularly review your investments to make sure they align with your changing tax and financial needs.
Rebalance your portfolio annually, especially if tax-saving limits are reached or if tax laws change.
Make Investments Before the Deadline

Be mindful of the deadlines, typically before the end of the financial year (31st March), to claim deductions for the current year.

Home Loan Tax Benefit - How To Save Income Tax On Your Home Loan?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

5 min read


If you are acquiring a home by taking a loan, then you can claim deductions on interest portion that you repay as a part of EMI, in accordance with the regulations of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 

While obtaining a housing loan can be costly, it is also possible to benefit from several tax deductions that can help you save money on taxes each year. It is important to understand how to maximize these benefits.

Home Loan Tax Benefit
Impact of New Tax Regime on Home Loan Benefits
Home Loan benefits under the old tax regime remain the same as one can avail deductions without any restrictions, however, the under new tax regime benefits are curtailed, let’s know in detail about the same

Deduction under section 80C for the payment towards principal component of the home loan, stamp duty, registration charges and Section 80EE, Section 80EEA are not available
Deduction under section 24(b) for the payment towards the interest component of the home loan is not available for self-occupied property.
However, deduction under section 24b is available for let-out property. If net income from let out property results in loss, then such loss will be allowed to set off against profit from another house property but not allowed to set off against other heads of income like salary or other sources.
Deduction for Interest Paid on Housing Loan under Section 24
A loan must be taken for the purchase or construction of a house property to claim a tax deduction. If it is taken for the construction of a house, then construction must be completed within five years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken.

The interest portion of the home loan EMI for the year can be claimed as a deduction from your total income up to a maximum of Rs 2 lakh under Section 24. 

From the assessment year 2018-19 onwards, the maximum deduction for interest paid on self-occupied house property is Rs 2 lakh.

For let out property, there is no upper limit for claiming tax exemption on interest, which means that you can claim deduction on the entire interest paid on your home loan. 

In case the construction exceeds the stipulated time, i.e. 5 years, you can claim deductions on interest of home loan only up to Rs 30,000 for the financial year.

ITR Filing Last Date 2024
The last date to file Income Tax Return (ITR) for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) without a late fee is 31st July 2024.

Deduction on Interest Paid Towards Home Loan During the Pre-Construction Period
Say you bought an under-construction property and have not moved in yet but you are paying the EMIs. In this case, your eligibility to claim interest on the home loan as a deduction begins only upon completion of construction or immediately if you buy a fully constructed property. 

So, does this mean you would not enjoy any tax benefits on the interest paid during the period falling between the borrowing of loan and completion of construction? Yes, it will be available but with some conditions and in future years.

Let’s understand how. 

The Income Tax Act allows you to claim a deduction for such interest, which is also called pre-construction interest. You are allowed to deduct it in five equal instalments starting from the year the property is acquired or construction is completed, over and above the deduction you are otherwise eligible to claim from your house property income. However, the maximum eligibility remains capped at Rs 2 lakh.

For example, you availed a home loan in April 2021 for construction and paid an interest of Rs 10,000 a month. Construction of the house was completed in April 2023 after two years. Hence, you can start claiming the pre-construction interest of Rs 2.4 lakh (approx) paid by you only after the construction gets completed in five equal instalments starting from the year 2023-24. Maximum interest deduction under Section 24(b) is capped at Rs 2 lakh (including current year interest + pre-construction interest). So if you paid interest of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year 2023-24 then you can claim a total interest deduction of Rs. 1,68,000 (i.e., Rs. 1,20,000 as current year interest and Rs. 48,000 as 1/5th installment of pre-construction interest).

Further, if your home loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80EEA, you can claim an additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh over and above the limit of Rs. 2 lakhs u/s 24(b). We have discussed Section 80EEA later in this article.

Deduction on Principal Repayment under Section 80C
The principal paid on the home loan EMI for the year is allowed as a deduction under section 80C. The maximum amount that can be claimed under this section is up to Rs 1.5 lakh.

But to claim this deduction, the house property should not be sold within five years of possession. Otherwise, the deduction claimed earlier will be added back to your income in the year of sale.

Deduction for Stamp Duty and Registration Charges under Section 80C
Besides claiming the deduction for principal repayment, a deduction for stamp duty and registration charges can also be claimed under Section 80C but within the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. 

However, it can be claimed only in the year these expenses are incurred.

Additional Deduction under Section 80EE
Additional deduction under Section 80EE is allowed to the home buyers for a maximum of up to Rs 50,000. To claim this deduction, the following conditions should be met:

The amount of loan taken should be Rs 35 lakh or less, and the property’s value shall not exceed Rs 50 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2017.
And on the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first-time house owner.
Additional Deduction under Section 80EEA
To promote the housing sector, Budget 2019 has introduced an additional deduction under Section 80EEA for homebuyers for a maximum of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. 

To claim this deduction, below mentioned conditions should be met:

The stamp value of the property does not exceed Rs 45 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022 (extended from 31 March 2021)
On the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first time home buyer.
The individual should not be eligible to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA if claiming a deduction under Section 80EE.
Deduction for Joint Home Loan
If the loan is taken jointly, each loan holder can claim a deduction for home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh each and principal repayment under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh each in their tax returns.

To claim this deduction, they should also be co-owners of the property taken on loan. So, a loan taken jointly with your family member can help you claim a larger tax benefit.

Loss under the Head House Property
If you have not let-out any of your house property then there are high chances that you might incur a loss under the head house property, reason being the interest deduction that you might avail u/s 24(b). Further, even if you have rented out the property, you can incur a loss under the head house property because there is no limit on interest on home loan deductions so your interest can exceed your rental income.

About NPS
NPS, or National Pension System, is a government-sponsored pension scheme available to both salaried and self-employed individuals. It offers dual benefit:

Tax savings during your working years
A regular income stream after retirement 
NPS is one of the most popular options for individuals seeking to create a retirement corpus and a regular monthly income. The money deposited in NPS is invested in various securities and investment avenues, including the equity market. It is widely regarded as one of the cheapest investment options with equity exposure. As the returns are directly related to the market performance, there is no guarantee of any particular amount. Still, over a period of time, returns from NPS have been among the highest in the market.

Two Types of NPS Accounts
There are two types of accounts in NPS, NPS Tier 1 and NPS Tier 2.

Tier 1 Account (Pension Account):This has a fixed lock-in period until the subscriber reaches the age of 60 years. Only partial withdrawal is allowed, with certain conditions. Contributions made towards Tier 1 are tax deductible and qualify for deductions under Section 80CCD(1) and Section 80CCD(1B). This means you can invest up to Rs. 2 lakhs in an NPS Tier 1 account and claim a deduction for the full amount, i.e. Rs. 1.50 lakh under Sec 80CCD(1) and Rs. 50,000/- under Section 80CCD(1B).
Tier 2 Account (Additional Account): This is a voluntary savings account that allows subscribers to make withdrawals as and when they like. Only the contributions made by a Central government employee to a Tier 2 account are eligible for tax deduction. To open a Tier 2 account, you must open a Tier 1 account first. The deposits made in the NPS Tier II accounts are eligible for an income tax deduction, under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, for government employees. On the other hand, there is no income tax deduction offered on NPS Tier II deposits for private-sector employees and the gains in the NPS Tier 2 are taxable at the respective slab rates.
Eligibility under Section 80CCD(1B)
An individual taxpayer is eligible to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(1B) by filing the income tax return under the old tax regime. 

However, there is an age restriction for opening an NPS account. The following individuals can open NPS:

Resident individuals between 18-70 years  
Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) aged between 18-70 years. However, if NRI’s citizenship changes after investing in NPS, the scheme will be terminated. 
How to Invest in NPS to Avail Tax Benefits?
Individuals can invest in NPS online or offline. NPS account can be opened online through the NSDL e-Gov portal, now known as protean. It can also be opened offline through a financial institution acting as a Point of Presence (POP). Most banks and non-banking financial companies are authorised to act as POPs. 

Things to Note while Claiming Deductions Under Section 80CCD(1B)
Here are some of the critical points about Section 80CCD(1B) that you should be aware of:

Individuals must file their taxes under the old tax regime, i.e., opting out of the applicability of sec 115BAC(1A).
The additional deduction of Rs. 50,000/- is available only for contributions made to NPS Tier 1 accounts
Tier 2 accounts are not eligible to claim the deduction under Section 80CCD(1B)
The deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) are available to salaried individuals as well as to self-employed individuals
You need to produce documentary evidence of the transaction related to the contribution to NPS
Partial withdrawals are allowed under NPS but are subject to specific terms and conditions
The total exemption limit under Section 80CCD(1B) is Rs. 50,000/- and is independent of exemptions under Section 80C. Thereby, you can claim a maximum deduction of  Rs. 2 lakhs
In case the assessee dies and the nominee decides to close the NPS account, then the amount received by the nominee is exempt from taxation
Documents Required to Claim Tax Benefit Under NPS

The following documents are required to be submitted while investing in NPS:

Bank account statement
PAN card
Aadhaar card
Taxation on NPS Withdrawal

If partial withdrawals are made from the account, then only 25% of the contribution made is exempt from taxation. If the assessee is an employee and decides to close the NPS account or opt out of NPS, then only 40% of the total amount is tax-exempt. The assessee can withdraw 60% of the entire amount upon reaching the age of 60 as tax-free income. The remaining 40% is also tax-free if it is used to purchase an annuity plan. 

Section 80CCD(1B) offers you an excellent opportunity to save a substantial amount on your taxation liabilities. This way, you can not only reduce your present tax liabilities but also work towards creating a substantial corpus for your retirement. Remember the points mentioned above, taking any action related to your NPS account regarding Section 80CCD(1B).

By Mohammed S Chokhawala

8 min read

The purpose of the Public Provident Fund (PPF), which was first implemented in India in 1968, was to mobilise small contributions for investment and return. It can also be referred to as an investment vehicle that enables one to accumulate retirement funds while reducing yearly taxes. Anyone looking for a safe investment option to save taxes and earn guaranteed returns should open a PPF account.


How Important is PPF?
The PPF (Public Provident Fund) is considered an excellent investment option, especially for people uncomfortable with taking risks. While the returns may not be very high because they depend on the market, they offer stability. Additionally, investing in PPF can help diversify your portfolio and has tax benefits.


However, please note that to receive interest on your PPF investments, they must be made on or before the 5th of each month, as the interest is calculated on the lowest balance at the credit of account between the close of the fifth day and the end of the month. 

What is PPF Account?
PPF – Key Information
Interest Rate	7.1% per annum.
Minimum Investment Amount	Rs.500
Maximum Investment Amount	Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.
Tenure	15 years
Risk Profile	Offers guaranteed, risk-free returns
Tax Benefit	Up to Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C
Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a long-term investment option that offers an attractive rate of interest and returns on the amount invested. The interest earned and the returns are not taxable under Income Tax. One has to open a PPF account under this scheme and the amount deposited during a year will be claimed under section 80C deductions.

Features of PPF account
Below are the essential features of PPF

Tenure: The PPF has a minimum tenure of 15 years, which can be extended in blocks of 5 years as per your wish.
Investment limits: PPF allows a minimum investment of Rs 500 and a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh for each financial year. Investments can be made in a lump sum or in a maximum of 12 instalments.
Opening balance: The account can be opened with just Rs 100 a month. Annual investments above Rs 1.5 lakh will not earn interest and will not be eligible for tax savings.
Deposit frequency: Deposits into a PPF account have to be made at least once every year for 15 years.
Mode of deposit: The deposit into a PPF account can be made either by way of cash, cheque, demand draft (DD) or through an online fund transfer.
Nomination: A PPF account holder can designate a nominee for his account either at the time of opening the account or subsequently.
Joint accounts: A PPF account can be held only in the name of one individual. Opening an account in joint names is not allowed.
Risk factor: Since PPF is backed by the Indian government, it offers guaranteed, risk-free returns as well as complete capital protection. The element of risk involved in holding a PPF account is minimal. As the returns from PPF accounts are fixed, they are used as a diversification tool for the investor’s portfolio. 
Tax benefit: The PPF interest and maturity amount are tax-free under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Partial withdrawal: PPF amount can be withdrawn partially from the 5th financial year onwards.
What is PPF Interest Rate?
The PPF interest rate for 2024-25 is 7.1% p.a., which is compounded annually. 
However, to receive the PPF interest for the deposit month, it is very important that you deposit your PPF amount within 5th of that month.


The Finance Ministry sets the interest rate every year, which is paid on 31st March. The interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the 5th day and the last day of every month. Thus, if you invest in PPF after the 5th day of the month, it will not be considered for interest calculation, and the balance which is there on the 5th day will be taken into consideration.

In a nutshell, the PPF contribution made on the 5th of a month will earn interest for that month, while any PPF contribution made after the 5th of the month will not earn interest and result in a loss of interest for that month.

Further, use our PPF calculator to figure out the returns you can expect on investing a certain amount in a PPF account.

How does the PPF Account Work?
A PPF account can be opened by an adult for self or on behalf of a minor. The account tenure is 15 years and the lock-in period for the account is 15 years. You can make a deposit to a PPF account ranging from Rs.500 up to Rs.1.5 lakh per financial year.

PPF Amount Withdrawal
As a rule, one can fully withdraw the PPF account balance only upon maturity, i.e. after the completion of 15 years. Upon completion of 15 years, the entire amount standing to the credit of an account holder in the PPF account along with the accrued interest can be withdrawn freely and the account can be closed.

However, if account holders are in need of funds, and wish to withdraw before 15 years, the scheme permits partial withdrawals from year 6 i.e. on completing 5 years. 

An account holder can withdraw prematurely, up to a maximum of 50% of the amount that is in the account at the end of the 4th year (preceding the year in which the amount is withdrawn or at the end of the preceding year, whichever is lower). Further, withdrawals can be made only once in a financial year.

Procedure for Withdrawal from PPF

Step 1: Get the application for withdrawal of PPF from the bank or post office where you opened the PPF account (Form 3/Form C).

Step 2: Fill in the application form with relevant information.

Step 3: Submit the application to the concerned branch of the bank or post office where your PPF account lies. 

PPF Withdrawal Form
An individual must file Form 3/Form C for the withdrawal of the PPF amount. This form has 3 sections:

Section 1: Declaration section where you must give your PPF account number and the amount of money you propose to withdraw. Along with that, you also need to mention how many years have actually passed since the account was first opened. 

Section 2: Office use section which comprises details like:

Section 3: The bank details section asks for the details of the bank where the money is to be credited directly or the bank in whose favour the cheque or the demand draft is to be issued. It is also mandatory to enclose a copy of the PPF passbook along with this application. 

PPF Tax Benefits
PPF is one investment vehicle that falls under the Exempt-Exempt-Exempt (EEE) category. This, in other words, means that all deposits made in the PPF are deductible under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. However, it should be noted that the maximum contribution in PPF cannot exceed Rs.1.5 lakh in one financial year.

Furthermore, the accumulated amount and interest is also exempt from tax at the time of withdrawal. It is important to note that a PPF account cannot be closed before maturity.

A PPF account, however, can be transferred from one point of designation to another. But, do remember that a PPF account cannot be closed prematurely. Only in the case of the account holder’s demise can the nominee file for the closure of the account. 

Process to Close a PPF account
As per the rules governing PPF accounts, you can fully withdraw your PPF account balance only after the account completes its tenure of 15 years. Upon completion of the 15-year term, you can access the entire account balance, withdraw it fully, and close the account.

Any time before completing the full tenure of the account, you cannot withdraw the entire account balance under any circumstances. However, premature withdrawal of up to 50% of the account balance is allowed after completing 5 years. This is permitted under special circumstances only.

You can close a PPF account after completing 15 years from the date of opening the account. The procedure to close a PPF account in the post office is given below:

Step 1: Fill up the relevant information in Form C and attach your PPF passbook.

Step 2: Submit this to the relevant Post Office/bank branch where the account is held.

PPF vs Mutual Funds
The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a savings scheme provided by the government, which offers guaranteed returns. However, there are other investment options available, such as mutual funds, that also offer tax-saving advantages. Mutual funds are investment vehicles that distribute funds among different types of assets, like stocks and bonds. They gather money from multiple investors and make strategic investments in securities.


Mutual funds have the potential to provide higher returns and greater liquidity compared to PPF. They are classified into different categories based on the asset class, such as equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. It's worth noting that only Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) among mutual funds are eligible for tax savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

Mutual funds have a proven history of delivering returns that have surpassed the market, making them a widely chosen investment option. Each category of mutual funds has its investment objective and level of risk.

Which is a Better Option: PPF or FD?
Public Provident Funds (PPF) and Fixed Deposits (FDs) provide guaranteed returns in the form of interest. However, there are significant differences between the two:

Tenure: FDs offer flexible tenures ranging from as short as 7 days to as long as 10 years, giving investors the freedom to select a duration that aligns with their preferences. On the contrary, PPF has a fixed tenure of 15 years, providing a stable and long-term savings option.

Taxation: PPF provides tax-free returns, while FDs are subject to taxation, including TDS.

Interest Rates: FD interest rates are determined by individual banks and can vary from one bank to another. Moreover, senior citizens often receive preferential treatment with higher interest rates on their FDs than regular citizens.

Loan Options: PPF allows for loans against the account, but the maximum loan amount is limited to 25% of the balance after 1 year. On the other hand, FDs also provide the option to take loans, allowing borrowers to access up to 90% of their deposit amount. The interest rate on an FD loan is usually 1-2 percentage points higher than the prevailing FD interest rate.

Loan Types: FDs can serve as collateral for different types of loans, such as home loans, business loans, and education loans, among others. The bank and the specific loan type determine the loan interest rate.

Is LIC better than Public Provident Fund?
There is often confusion regarding the difference between investment and insurance. Insurance protects against risks, while investment aims to secure a stable financial future. Investors must prioritise their financial well-being by maintaining an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses, obtaining insurance coverage for protection against accidents or unforeseen events, and saving for a secure future.

Having insurance is crucial for investors who have dependents relying on their income. There are different types of insurance schemes available, including term insurance, ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans), and endowment plans. However, it is advisable to prioritise a term insurance policy for adequate coverage and consider investing in a PPF for long-term savings.

A cost-effective approach to combining insurance and investment security is by opting for a term insurance policy along with a PPF. Rather than comparing the superiority of LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) and PPF, the emphasis should be on selecting an appropriate term policy that complements the PPF and meets your insurance needs.

Insurance plans with investment options like ULIPs can indeed have high expense ratios and hidden charges. Therefore, it is generally recommended to separate investment and insurance needs. Choosing a term insurance policy alongside investing in a PPF is a prudent strategy that allows individuals to enjoy the benefits of insurance and investment without unnecessary complexities. This approach ensures a clear and straightforward approach to meet both objectives effectively.

Public Provident Fund (PPF) Limitations
PPF accounts do have certain drawbacks that should be considered:

1. Lock-in Period: PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years, which is longer than other tax-saving investments like Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) with a lock-in period of just three years. This extended lock-in period can pose challenges in case of emergencies or when there is a need for funds during the investment period. As discussed earlier, premature withdrawals are allowed in PPF, but there are restrictions and regulations on when and how much you can withdraw. Therefore, it's important to ensure that you can commit to investing in a PPF account for 15 years.

2. Moderate Interest Rate: The interest rate offered on PPF accounts is not very high, especially considering it is a long-term investment scheme. In contrast, ELSS has the potential to provide double-digit returns to investors.

3. No Joint Holding: PPF accounts cannot be held jointly, which can be a limitation if you intend to open a joint account with your spouse or other family members.

4. Investment Limit: The maximum amount that can be invested in a PPF account in a year is ₹1.5 lakh. However, there is no limit to the amount you can invest in other tax-saving instruments like ELSS funds, NPS, or FDs, although the maximum tax benefit that can be claimed remains the same at ₹1.5 lacks under Section 80C.

5. NRI Restrictions: While resident Indians can open new PPF accounts, this option is unavailable for NRIs. If you had a PPF account as a resident Indian and have become an NRI, you can continue making deposits into the account, but you cannot open new PPF accounts.


6. Annual Contribution Requirement: PPF mandates a minimum annual contribution to keep the account active. Failing to contribute the minimum amount can lead to the account becoming inactive, and reactivating it requires paying a penalty.

Considering these drawbacks, it is important to carefully evaluate your financial goals and circumstances before investing in a PPF account.

Conclusion 
If you prefer low-risk investments and value the security provided by government-backed instruments, PPF can be a suitable choice.

Login
Login to your Cleartax account and click on ‘Start Filing’.

ITR filing page of ClearTax
Create an Account or Login with ClearTax
Create a new account or simply click on Login if you are already a user of ClearTax.

Create an account or Login
Link Your PAN
Linking your PAN allows us to submit your return to the income tax department. 

If you are filing with us for the first time, you need to link your PAN by entering your PAN, Date of Birth, and the OTP received on your registered mobile number. You can verify the OTP using either your 'Aadhaar registered mobile number' or ‘IT Department registered mobile number.’

Link your Pan to e-file
Pre-fill Your Personal Information
If you have previously filed with Cleartax and your PAN is already linked, you will directly see the autofill screen. To pre-fill your information from the income tax department, you will need to complete another OTP verification. This OTP verification is to capture all your personal information and income details in your income tax return with maximum security of your data.


If you choose the 'IT Department' option, you will need to enter two OTPs, one sent to your mobile number and the other to your email.

Too many OTPs can seem a lot of effort, but it is totally worth it! Most of your information will be auto-filled. This saves you nearly 2 hours of your time that would have been spent manually entering and correcting details. Review the auto-filled information and modify if necessary.

Pre-fill information
Upload Form 16
Scroll down and find the 'Upload Form 16' option. By uploading your Form 16, your salary details will be automatically captured. If you do not have Form 16, you can still proceed directly to e-filing by clicking on “Continue to e-file”. You can also upload multiple Form-16's if you have switched jobs in the Financial Year.

Form 16 upload
Form 16 successful

ClearTax will then automatically calculate your income along with the exemptions, deductions, etc., based on the details provided in FORM-16. You will now be redirected to this page, where you can see all your personal details, such as your name, address, bank details, etc.

Note: If you prefer skipping the pre-fill option, you can manually enter the details.

Here, you will see 4 tabs: Personal Info, Income Sources, Tax Saving and Tax Summary. 

Personal Information
All your personal details like name, address and other details will appear here. You can expand each section and review these details. You also have the option to edit them, if required. 

Personal Information 
Income Sources
Go to the ‘Income Sources’ tab. 

Salary
If you didn't upload Form 16 earlier, you can upload it here and fill in the salary details.

Salary Income
Rental Income or House property
Enter the income from house property, considering whether you occupy the house or have rented it out.

Income from House property
Capital gain
If you have sold assets like stocks, mutual funds, Gold, bonds, shares received as a part of ESOP or RSU scheme, land or building, then the profit/loss from such transactions must be reported under capital gains section. 

Capital gains

1. Stocks and Mutual Funds: 
Simply choose your stockbroker from the available options and log in to your investment account. Your capital gains will be calculated within seconds. Cleartax can effortlessly import and process thousands of transactions from your profit and loss (P&L) report to accurately determine the capital gains amount.
If you have done any intraday transactions, they will be automatically categorized as business income rather than capital gains. 
We don’t have the login option for some brokers yet, but you can directly drag and drop or upload the P&L report here. 
If your broker is not listed, you can download the excel template, fill in the required details, and upload the completed template.
For mutual funds, you should upload the P&L report from CAMS or Karvy by selecting their respective icons. You can also navigate to the "Mutual Funds" tab, where you will find CAMS, KARVY, and a few other brokers. Upload the P&L report here and your capital gains will be computed. If you have non-demat mutual funds, please upload files from both Karvy and CAMS. However, if you don't have the excel files or if your broker's name is not listed, you can manually add the details as well.
2. US or foreign stocks
A separate section is dedicated to reporting capital gain details from foreign stocks. Similar to stocks, you can either import the details directly from your broker. Currently, we support transactions from brokers like INDMoney and Vested. Even if your broker isn't mentioned, you can use our excel template to report all the transactions at once.

3. ESOPs and RSUs
If you have sold the shares received under ESOP or RSU scheme, you can add the following details under this section:

type of shares (that is, whether they are listed or not listed), 
date of purchase and sale and 
value of purchase-sale and brokerage expenses. 
Your capital gains will be calculated. 

Likewise, you can add details for all the other assets like Bonds, gold, land and buildings

Professional, Freelancing and Business Income
So broadly, there are 5 sub-sections here:

The first section is 44ADA- this is for professionals. 
The income tax law has specified a few professions and made it clear that only these professionals can opt for 44ADA: 
- Legal
- Medical
- Engineering
- Architecture
- Accountancy
- Technical Consultancy
- Interior Decoration
- Film Artists like cameraman, producer, editor, actor, director, singer, etc are specified.

Under the “Nature of Business”, you will find approximately 40 codes. Select the appropriate code. If you're unsure of the code, simply search for your profession. Also, mention the trade name and description. If you have multiple professions, you can include them all. 
The next condition here is that your revenue should be less than equal to 75 lakhs. If your revenue is more than 75 lakhs, you will have to file taxes normally and you will not be eligible to opt for the presumptive scheme. Revenue is nothing but the total amount you have received for the service offered. It is also called gross receipts. Some folks call it consultation fees. For example, if you are  a practicing lawyer and your clients pay you 1 lakh rupees towards a case, that 1 lakh would be considered as Revenue. 
The other condition is that your expenses cannot be more than 50% i.e. by default it is assumed that your expenses or cost will not be more than 50% of your income. Say your revenue is 20 lakhs, then your expenses has to be up to 10 lakhs. You can show a lower amount say 7 lakhs, then you’ll pay taxes on 13 lakhs but you cannot show a higher amount than 10 lakhs. Let’s add 12 lakhs. If you enter an incorrect amount, you will see error prompts immediately which will guide you whether you are eligible for the presumptive scheme or not. So there is no scope of mistake here.

You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.
Now let’s look at the second section, i.e. 44AD
44AD is mainly for small businesses say a private tutor, web designer, freelance content writer, small business owners. Just like there were some conditions under 44ADA, there are some conditions for 44AD too. 
- The first condition is that your turnover, i.e. nothing but your sales, must be less than 3 crores and 
- the second condition is that your profit must be more than or equal to 8% of your turnover. So if your revenue is say 1 crore, then your profit should be atleast 8 lakhs and you will have to pay taxes on this profit.
But if you have received the money through digital means, then you can pay taxes on only 6% profit instead of 8%. Even if you have received them through Phonepe or GooglePay, that would be considered as digital means. Here again, you will have to select the nature of business, trade name etc There are nearly 200 codes you can choose from.
Add the sales amount you’ve received through digital and non-digital modes separately here. The profit for digital transactions should be atleast 6% and for non-digital it should be atleast 8%. Now you can fill up the assets and liabilities details and proceed. 
There will be some freelancers who would be working independently and running unrelated small businesses too. So they can declare income under both 44AD and 44ADA, as long as the conditions are met.
If your revenue and expense conditions are not met, then you can fill in all the details under the third section. We will automatically select the correct ITR form for you, i.e. ITR-3.
You can add all your other business income here and fill up the Balance sheet and P&L
You have to fill all the Financial particulars if you have the presumptive income. You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why is income tax return filing important?

Here's a detailed list of exemptions and deductions available under the Old vs New Regime.

Old Tax Regime Vs New Tax Regime - Which is Better?
The new tax regime can largely benefit middle-class taxpayers who have a taxable income of up to Rs 15 lakh. The old regime is a better option for high-income earners.

The new income tax regime is beneficial for people who make low investments. As the new regime offers six lower-income tax slabs, anyone paying taxes without claiming tax deductions can benefit from paying a lower rate of tax under the new tax regime. For instance, the assessee having total income before deduction up to Rs 12 lakh will have higher tax liability under the old system if they have investments less than Rs. 3,12,500. Therefore, if you invest less in tax-saving schemes, go for the new regime.

That being said, if you already have in place a financial plan for wealth creation by making investments in tax-saving instruments; medical claims and life insurance; making payments of children’s tuition fees; payment of EMIs on education loan; buying a house with a home loan; and so on, the old regime helps you with higher tax deductions and lower tax outgo.

In light of the above and considering the new income tax regime, if taxpayers want to opt for the concessional tax rates, they may evaluate both regimes. Hence, it is advisable to do a comparative evaluation and analysis under both regimes and then choose the most beneficial one, as it may vary from person to person. Read a detailed breakdown on this topic here.

The government introduced various incentives in the recent times to encourage the adoption of the new regime. 

These changes show that the government intends to have taxpayers transition to the new regime and eventually phase out the old one. Though the new regime is now the default tax regime, the old tax regime will continue to exist.

Budget 2025 Update
The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how!

The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows:

Current Tax Rates under New Tax Regime
New Tax Regime
A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D , and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in the Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes, which remain the same even for FY 2024-2025 since no changes were made in the Interim Budget 2024, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime. They are:

Higher Tax Rebate Limit: Full tax rebate on an income up to ₹7 lakhs is allowed. Whereas this threshold is ₹5 lakhs under the old tax regime. This means that taxpayers with an income of up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay any tax at all under the new tax regime! 
Streamlined Tax Slabs: The tax exemption limit is up-to ₹3 lakhs, and the new tax slabs are:

Salary income: The standard deduction of ₹50,000, which was only available under the old regime, has now been extended to the new tax regime as well. This amount has been increased to ₹75,000 for the new regime only with effect from FY 2024-25.
Family pension: Those receiving a family pension can claim a deduction of ₹15,000 or 1/3rd of the pension, whichever is lower. This amount has been increased to ₹25,000 for the new regime with effect from FY 2024-25.
Reduced Surcharge for High Net Worth Individuals: The surcharge rate on income over ₹5 crores has been reduced from 37% to 25%. This move will bring down their effective tax rate from 42.74% to 39%. 
Higher Leave Encashment Exemption: The exemption limit for non-government employees has been raised from ₹3 lakhs to ₹25 lakhs, an 8-fold increase.
Default Regime: Starting from FY 2023-24, the new income tax regime will be set as the default option. If you want to continue using the old regime, you must submit the income tax return along with Form 10-IEA before the due date. You will have the option to switch between the two regimes annually to check the tax benefits.
Old Tax Regime
The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime.

Difference Between Old Vs New Tax Regime: Which is Better for FY 2024-25?
The decision to switch to the new or remain in the old tax regime or which regime is better for you shall be based on the tax savings deductions and exemptions you are eligible for in the old tax regime. To make it easier, we have calculated a breakeven point for various income levels (refer to the table below) for a salaried individual below 60 years of age. This can be used to determine which regime to choose.

The Breakeven Threshold for Deciding Between New vs Old Tax Regimes for FY 2023-24
The Breakeven point is the amount at which there will be no difference in tax liability between the two tax regimes. 

If your total eligible deductions and exemptions in the old tax regime are higher than the breakeven threshold for your income level, it is advisable to stay in the old regime. On the other hand, if the breakeven threshold is higher, then moving to the new tax regime is more beneficial.

How to Choose Between Old and New Tax Regimes?
When deciding between the two tax regimes, it is important to take into account the tax exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime. After deducting all eligible exemptions and deductions, the net taxable income can be determined. By calculating the tax liability based on this net taxable income under the old tax regime, it becomes possible to compare it with the tax liability under the new tax regime.

Choosing the regime with the lower tax liability is the logical approach, and it is essential to inform the employer about this choice so that the appropriate Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) can be deducted from the salary.

If you have a loss from house property, capital gains, or business & profession, you need to consider them as well while making informed decisions on the selection of regime. Along with the current year's losses, even the previous year's losses eligible to set off will get lapsed as well. Ineligibility to carry forward such losses may impact your future income determination and taxes thereon.

Conclusion
Many individuals often find themselves questioning the disparities between the old and new tax regimes. The new income tax regime is designed to accommodate those who have more personal commitments such as repayment of personal/vehicle loans, medical treatment of parents or dependents, or wish to avoid the burden of extensive tax preparation or have minimal tax deductions due to their ineligibility for section 10 exemptions, standard deductions, tax on employment, employer contribution to pension scheme etc., Conversely, the old tax regime can yield more tax savings for senior citizens, who derive a substantial portion of their income from interest, can benefit from Section 80TTB, which allows them to claim Rs.50,000 as interest income deduction and feel more secure under the old tax regime.

Both the old and new tax regimes possess advantages and disadvantages. The previous tax structure encourages taxpayers to cultivate a habit of saving, while the new tax structure favours employees with lower earnings and investments, resulting in fewer deductions and exemptions. The new tax system is considered safer and simpler, involving fewer records and reducing the potential for tax evasion fraud. However, due to the unique nature of individual deductions and exemptions, a thorough comparison of the two regimes is necessary to determine the best fit for each person.

In case you have incurred losses from sources like the stock market, mutual funds, properties, or any of your businesses, you have the option to carry them forward and offset them against your income in the subsequent year. This provision substantially reduces your tax liability in future years. However, you will not be allowed to carry forward these losses if you miss filing your ITR before the deadline.

What if ITR Filing is Missed?
Belated Return
If you miss the ITR filing due date, you can file a return after the due date, called a belated return.

The last date for filing a belated return is 31st December of the assessment year (unless extended by the government). 

Updated Return
Still, if you miss the 31st December deadline due to unavoidable reasons still you can file the updated (ITR U) return subject to the conditions specified therein. Click here to know more.

The return you will file in the upcoming year is for the income you earned in FY 2024-25, i.e. for the income earned between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025. The assessment year is the review year for FY 2024-2025, where you file your returns and declare your returns by declaring all the incomes, exemptions, deductions, losses etc., already made or incurred during the year for tax assessment. For the income earned during the FY (here FY 2024-25), the assessment year would be the immediately next year, i.e. 1st April 2025 to 31st March 2026. Hence, the assessment year would be AY 2025-26.

An Income Tax Refund is issued by the Income Tax Department if a taxpayer has paid more income tax than was due for the financial year. Individuals/Businesses pay income tax through TDS deducted, advance tax on the basis of anticipated liability, or self-assessment tax which might exceed the actual tax liability. In some cases, an income tax refund can also arise in case the tax liability is reduced by claiming deductions, exemptions, set off of losses, or tax credits while filing the income tax return.

Post-filing, the Income Tax Authorities assess the taxpayer's tax liability. In case the tax liability assessed exceeds the amount paid, the excess tax paid is refunded to the taxpayer along with interest at 0.5% per month or part of the month (i.e. 6% per annum) until the date of refund.

How to Calculate the Income Tax Refund with Example?
If you paid more taxes than you were required to pay, you can claim the additional amount as an income tax refund.

Income Tax Refund = Total Taxes paid – Total tax liability 

If the taxes paid (either by way of Advance Tax or TDS or TCS or Self-Assessment Tax) are more than the actual tax amount due, then the excess tax paid can be claimed as a refund. The income tax department will recompute the taxes and validate the refund claim before initiating the refund.

For example: Assume Mr. Gupta paid 3 lakh as an advance tax during the financial year. At the end of the financial year, he learns his tax liability is only 2 lakh. He can request a refund by filing an income tax return (ITR). If the assessing officer approves his request, the excess tax amount of 1 lakh will be credited to Mr Gupta's pre-validated bank account.

3 lakh Advance Tax - 2 lakh Tax liability = 1 lakh Tax refund for Mr. Gupta 

The excess amount will be refunded along with interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of the month. If the refund is received in September, then interest of Rs. 3,000 (1,00,000*0.5%*6) will also be credited to the bank account.

How to Claim an Income Tax Refund?

To get your income tax refund or TDS refund, all you need to do is file your Income Tax Return and declare your income, deduction and tax paid details to the Income Tax Department. Once the ITR is processed successfully and if there is any excess tax, it will be issued in your prevalidated bank account. Follow the process and file your ITR via Cleartax.

Process to file on Cleartax

Is the Income Tax Refund Taxable?
No, the refund amount is not taxable. But, the interest received on the tax refund is taxable. The rate of tax on the interest would be as per your applicable tax slab rate.

What is the Time Duration for a Tax Refund?
The time taken to receive the income tax refund entirely depends on the Income Tax Department’s internal process. Generally, it takes around 7 to 120 days, with an average time of 90 days after you have e-verified your return. The Income Tax Department implemented a new refund processing system to enable faster refund processing with an expected turnaround of a few days instead of a few months.        
Consistent with this objective, the average ITR processing duration has been reduced to 10 days for returns submitted in the AY 2023-24, as opposed to 82 days for returns submitted in the AY 2019-20 and 16 days for returns submitted in AY 2022-23.

What is the Mode of Receiving the Refund?
The Income Tax Department will send the refund amount through electronic mode (direct credit to the account) or through a ‘Refund Cheque’. You must enter the correct bank account number and IFSC code with complete address details, including the PIN code, at the time of filing your return to receive refunds. Refunds sent through cheques are dispatched to the address mentioned in the ITR through speed post.

What is the Interest on Income Tax Refund?

When the refund amount is more than 10% of the total tax payable for that particular year, you will receive a simple interest on the tax refund. Interest is computed at 6% per annum (0.5% per month or part of the month) on the refund amount. Here's how the interest on refund is computed:

Calculate interest on refund @0.5% per month

How to Claim Refund for Missed ITR Filing on Due Date?

Investment in a immovable property, predominantly house is one of the most sought-after investments primarily because you get to own a house. While others may invest with the intention of earning a profit upon selling the property in the future. It is important to note that a house property is regarded as a capital asset for income tax purposes. Consequently, any gain or loss incurred from the sale of an immovable property may be subject to tax under the 'Capital Gains' head. Similarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investments. We will delve into the chapter on ‘Capital gains’ in detail here.

What is Capital Gains Tax in India?
Any profit or gain that arises from the sale of a ‘capital asset’ is known as ‘income from capital gains’. Such capital gains are taxable in the year in which the transfer of the capital asset takes place. This is called capital gains tax. There are two types of Capital Gains: short-term capital gains(STCG) and long-term capital gains(LTCG).

Defining Capital Assets
Land, building, house property, vehicles, patents, trademarks, leasehold rights, machinery, and jewellery are a few examples of capital assets. This includes having rights in or in relation to an Indian company. It also includes the rights of management or control or any other legal right.

 The following do not come under the category of capital asset:

a. Any stock, consumables or raw material, held for the purpose of business or profession

b. Personal goods such as clothes and furniture held for personal use

c. Agricultural land in rural(*) India

d. 6½% gold bonds (1977) or 7% gold bonds (1980) or National Defence gold bonds (1980) issued by the central government

e. Special bearer bonds (1991)

f. Gold deposit bond issued under the gold deposit scheme (1999) or deposit certificates issued under the Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 and Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2019 notified by the Central Government.

*Definition of rural area (effective from AY 2014-15) – Any area which is outside the jurisdiction of a municipality or cantonment board, having a population of 10,000 or more is considered a rural area. Also, it should not fall within a distance given below

> 10,000

2

> 2 kms but < 6 kms

> 1,00,000

3

> 6 kms but < 8 kms

> 10,00,000

 


Types of Capital Assets?
1. STCA ( Short-term capital asset ) An asset held for a period of 24 months or less is a short-term capital asset. So, if you sell the asset within a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a short-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the holding period is reduced to 24 months and 12 months. 

Some assets are considered short-term capital assets when these are held for 12 months or less. This rule is applicable if the date of transfer is after 10th July 2014 (irrespective of what the date of purchase is). These assets are:

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
2. LTCA ( Long-term capital asset ): An asset held for more than 24 months is a long-term capital asset. They will be classified as a long-term capital asset if held for more than 24 months as earlier. So, if you sell the asset after a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a long-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the applicable holding period is 12 months. 

Capital assets such as land, building and house property shall be considered as long-term capital asset if the owner holds it for a period of 24 months or more (from FY 2017-18).

Whereas, below-listed assets if held for a period of more than 12 months, shall be considered as long-term capital asset.

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
Note: Capital gains from the sale of units of a specified mutual fund acquired on or after April 1, 2023, and market-linked debentures will always be treated as short-term capital gains, regardless of how long they have been held.

Classification of Inherited Capital Asset
In case an asset is acquired by gift, will, succession or inheritance, the period for which the asset was held by the previous owner is also included in determining whether it’s a short term or a long-term capital asset. In the case of bonus shares or rights shares, the period of holding starts from the date of allotment of bonus shares or rights shares respectively.

How Will Change in Income Tax Rules Affect Taxation on Debt Mutual Funds?
Here is calculation of the tax on debt funds before and after the investments as per the new regime:

Suppose Mr. Vinay invested Rs. 10,00,000 in FY 2018-19 in a debt mutual fund. He sold the investment after four years in FY 2024-25 for Rs. 18,00,000, resulting in a capital gain of Rs.8,00,000.

Calculating Capital Gains
Capital gains are calculated differently for assets held for a longer period and for those held over a shorter period.

Terms You Need to Know:
Full value consideration: The consideration received or to be received by the seller as a result of transfer of his capital assets. Capital gains are chargeable to tax in the year of transfer, even if no consideration has been received.

Cost of acquisition: The value for which the capital asset was acquired by the seller.   
Cost of improvement: Expenses of a capital nature incurred in making any additions or alterations to the capital asset by the seller.

Note:

In certain cases where the capital asset becomes the property of the taxpayer otherwise than by an outright purchase by the taxpayer, the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement incurred by the previous owner would also be included.
Improvements made before April 1, 2001, is never taken into consideration.
How to Calculate Short-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Cost of acquisition
Cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54B/54D

Step 4: This amount is a short-term capital gain to be taxed

Short-term capital gain =	Full value consideration   
Less: Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer( for e.g. brokerage on sale)   
Less: Cost of acquisition   
Less: Cost of improvement
How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Indexed cost of acquisition
Indexed cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54, 54D, 54EC, 54F, and 54B 

Long-term capital gain=	Full value consideration   
Less : Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer   
Less: Indexed cost of acquisition   
Less: Indexed cost of improvement   
Less: Expenses that can be deducted from full value for consideration*
(*Expenses from sale proceeds from a capital asset, that wholly and directly relate to the sale or transfer of the capital asset are allowed to be deducted. These are the expenses which are necessary for the transfer to take place.)

Exception: 

Long-term capital gains on the sale of equity shares/ units of equity oriented fund, realised after 31st March 2018, will remain exempt up to Rs. 1.25 lakh per annum.
If the transfer happened on or before 23/07/2024, tax at @ 10% will be levied only on LTCG on shares/units of equity oriented fund exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh in one financial year without the benefit of indexation.
If the transfer happened after 23/07/2024, tax rate is 12.5%. Exemption of Rs. 1.25 Lakh available.
Deductible Expenses
A. Sale of house property: These expenses are deductible from the total sale price:

Brokerage or commission paid for securing a purchaser
Cost of stamp papers
Travelling expenses in connection with the transfer – these may be incurred after the transfer has been affected
Where property has been inherited, expenditure incurred with respect to procedures associated with the will and inheritance, obtaining succession certificate, costs of the executor, may also be allowed in some cases
B. Sale of shares: You may be allowed to deduct these expenses:

Broker’s commission related to the shares sold
STT or securities transaction tax is not allowed as a deductible expense
C. Where jewellery is sold: In case of sale of broker’s jewellery and where a broker’s services were involved in securing a buyer, the cost of these services can be deducted.

Note: The expenses deducted from the sale price of assets for calculating capital gains are not allowed as a deduction under any other head of income, and you can claim them only once.

Indexed Cost of Acquisition/Improvement
The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.   
Refer to this page for the complete list of CII.  

The indexed cost of acquisition is calculated as:

Indexed cost of   
acquisition =	(Cost of acquisition X   
CII of the year in which the asset is transferred ) /   
CII of the year in which the asset was first held by the seller or FY 2001-02, whichever is later   
 
The cost of acquisition of the assets acquired before 1st April 2001 should be actual cost or FMV as on 1st April 2001, as per taxpayer’s option.

The indexed cost of improvement is calculated as:

Indexed cost of improvement =	Cost of improvement x CII (year of asset transfer) / CII (year of asset improvement)
Note: Improvements made before 1st April 2001, should not be considered.

Note: The indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

Exemption on Capital Gains
Example: Manya bought a house in July 2004 for Rs.50 lakh, and the full value of consideration received in FY 2016-17 is Rs.1.8 crore.   
Capital asset type: Since this property has been held for over 2 years, this would be a long-term capital asset.

Cost of acquisition: The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken. Using the indexed cost of acquisition formula, the adjusted cost of the house is Rs 1.17 crore. (Refer CII here for the calculations)

Capital gain: Hence, the net capital gain is Rs 63, 00,000.

Tax: Long-term capital gains on sale of house property are taxed at 20%. For a net capital gain of Rs 63, 00,000, the total tax outgo will be Rs.12,97,800.

This is a significant amount of money to be paid out in taxes. This can be lowered by taking benefit of exemptions provided by the Income Tax Act on capital gains when profit from the sale is reinvested into buying another asset.

Section 54: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Purchase of Another House Property
Budget 2019 announcement!  

Capital gains exemption under Section 54: Taxpayers can get an exemption from long-term capital gain from the sale of house property by investing in up to two house properties against the earlier provision of one house property with same conditions. However, the capital gain on the sale of house property must not exceed Rs 2 crores.

The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).

The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on sale.

Conditions for availing this benefit:

The new property can be purchased either 1 year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property.
The gains can also be invested in the construction of a property, but construction must be completed within three years from the date of sale.
In the Budget for 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the capital gains to claim this exemption.
Please note that this exemption can be taken back if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase/completion of construction.
The capital gains tax exemption limit under Section 54 to 54F is restricted to Rs.10 crore. Earlier, there was no threshold.

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  then One residential house property should be purchased within 1 year before the date of sale of house property or 2 years after the date of sale of house property; (OR) Construct a house property within 3 years after the date of sale of house property.

Section 54F: Exemption on capital gains on sale of any asset other than a house property
Exemption under Section 54F is available when there are capital gains from the sale of a long-term asset other than a house property. You must invest the entire sale consideration and not only capital gain to buy a new residential house property to claim this exemption. Purchase the new property either one year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property. You can also use the gains to invest in the construction of a property. However, the construction must be completed within 3 years from the date of sale.

In Budget 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the sale consideration to claim this exemption. This exemption can be taken back, if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase. If the entire sale proceeds are invested towards the new house, the entire capital gain will be exempt from taxes if you meet the above-said conditions.

However, if you invest a portion of the sale proceeds, the capital gains exemption will be in the proportion of the invested amount to the sale price LTCG exemption = Capital gains x Cost of new house / Net consideration.

Section 54EC: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Reinvesting in specific bonds
Exemption is available under Section 54EC when capital gains from sale of the first property are reinvested into specific bonds.

If you are not keen to reinvest your profit from the sale of your first property into another one, then you can invest them in bonds for up to Rs. 50 lakhs issued by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
The money invested can be redeemed after 5 years, but they cannot be sold before the lapse of 5 years from the date of sale.
The homeowner has six month’s time to invest the profit in these bonds. But to be able to claim this exemption, you will have to invest before the tax filing deadline.
Section 54B: Exemption on Capital Gains From Transfer of Land Used for Agricultural Purpose
When you make short-term or long-term capital gains from transfer of land situated in Urban area used for agricultural purposes – by an individual or the individual’s parents or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) – for 2 years before the sale, exemption is available under Section 54B. The exempted amount is the investment in a new asset or capital gain, whichever is lower. You must reinvest into a new agricultural land (in urban or rural area) within 2 years from the date of transfer. 

The new agricultural land, which is purchased to claim capital gains exemption, should not be sold within a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase. In case you are not able to purchase agricultural land before the date of furnishing of your income tax return, the amount of capital gains must be deposited before the date of filing of return in the deposit account in any branch (except rural branch) of a public sector bank or IDBI Bank according to the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

Exemption can be claimed for the amount which is deposited. If the amount which was deposited as per Capital Gains Account Scheme was not used for the purchase of agricultural land, it shall be treated as capital gains of the year in which the period of 2 years from the date of sale of land expires. If you wish to know more about investment choices with good capital gains potential, please invest with ClearTax Invest. Our handpicked plans can help you build a portfolio that is best suited to your financial goals and risk profile.

Section 54D: Capital Gains on transfer of  land and building which is used for  industrial undertaking 
Conditions to be fulfilled :

There must be compulsory purchase of land and building which is used for an industrial undertaking.
The land and building should have been used by the assessee for purposes of the business of the industrial undertaking in the 2 years before the date of transfer.
The assessee must purchase any other land or building or construct any building (for shifting or re-establishing the existing undertaking or setting up a new industrial undertaking) within 3 years from the date of transfer.
If such investment is not made before the date of filing of return of income, then the capital gain has to be deposited under the CGAS.
Amount of exemption :

If the cost of a new asset is more than or equal to the sale consideration, then the entire capital gain will be exempted.
If the cost of a new asset is lesser than Capital gains, capital gains to the extent of the cost of a new asset is exempt. i.e. the cost of a new asset will be exempted.
When can you invest in Capital Gains Account Scheme?
Finding a suitable seller, arranging the requisite funds and getting the paperwork in place for a new property is one time-consuming process. Fortunately, the Income Tax Department agrees with these limitations. If capital gains have not been invested until the due date of filing of return (usually 31 July) of the financial year in which the property is sold, the gains can be deposited in a PSU bank or other banks as per the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

This deposit can then be claimed as an exemption from capital gains, and no tax has to be paid on it. However, if the money is not invested, the deposit shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the year in which the specified period lapses.

Saving Tax on Sale of Agricultural Land
In some cases, capital gains made from the sale of agricultural land may be entirely exempt from income tax or it may not be taxed under the head capital gains. See below:

a. Agricultural land in a rural area in India is not considered a capital asset and therefore any gains from its sale are not chargeable to tax. For details on what defines an agricultural land in a rural area, see above.

b. Do you hold agricultural land as stock-in-trade? If you are into buying and selling land regularly or in the course of your business, in such a case, any gains from its sale are taxable under the head Business and Profession.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is the benefit of indexation available for computing capital gains arising on sale of a short-term capital asset?


Capital gains is determined by reducing the purchase price from the sale price. However, for an asset that has been held for a long time, it would not be appropriate to determine gains by merely reducing purchase price from sale price without giving any effect to the inflation. Hence, the concept of indexing the purchase price has been brought in. This way, the indexed purchase price can be reduced from sale price to determine gains. So, indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.

Should an NRI pay taxes on gains made on the sale of property in India?


Property sold in India is generally subject to tax deduction. The person buying the property must deduct taxes at the rate applicable to the NRI’s income slab, if the property is a short-term asset. If the property is a long-term asset, 20% LTCG tax is charged. Further, it is important for the NRI to ensure that taxes are deducted on the gains made and not on the sale proceeds. A jurisdictional Assessing Officer can help to determine the gains on which taxes should be deducted by the purchaser.

Can I set off my short-term capital loss against any other head of income?


First and foremost, capital losses can be set off only against capital gains. Accordingly, short-term capital losses can be set off against any income under capital gains be it short-term or long-term. However, long-term capital losses can be set off only against long-term capital gains.

What is the rate of tax on long-term capital gains on sale of house property?

Long-term capital gains on sale of house property is taxable at the rate of 20% flat on the quantum of gains made. However according to Budget 2024,  The tax on long-term capital gains on other financial and non-financial assets is reduced from 20% to 12.5%. While on the other hand, the indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

Some of these changes were - the introduction of the standard deduction, raising the basic exemption limit, a hike in tax rebate under Section 87A for taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh and so on. In the July 2024 budget, the government tweaked the income tax slabs under the new tax regime further.

There are no changes in the income tax slabs of the old tax regime in the July Budget 2024. Remember, income tax slabs under the new tax regime are tweaked. It will mean that anyone choosing the old tax regime for the current financial year 2024-25 (April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025) will calculate the income tax payable at the same rates as in FY 2023-24 (April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024).

Under the old tax regime, income tax slabs applicable to an individual depend on the age of an individual in a particular financial year. Hence, the basic exemption limit will also be different for individuals.

For an individual below 60 years of age, the basic exemption limit is of Rs 2.5 lakh. For senior citizens (aged 60 years and above but below 80 years) the basic income exemption limit is of Rs 3 lakh. For super senior citizens (aged 80 years and above), the basic income exemption limit is Rs 5 lakh. For non-resident individuals, the basic income exemption limit is of Rs 2.5 lakh irrespective of age.

Given below are the income tax rates for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26), FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24) and FY 2021-22 (AY 2022-23) under the old tax regime.

How to calculate income tax payable under new tax regime
For those salaried individuals who are continuing with the new tax regime for the current financial year, 2024-25, should know how to calculate income tax payable. It is important to remember that income tax slabs have been tweaked in new tax regime. Hence, knowing the correct way to calculate is important.

Further, for FY 2024-25, deductions available under new tax regime for a salaried individual have also been tweaked. A salaried individual can claim - i) Standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income instead of Rs 50,000 earlier, and ii) Section 80CCD (2) deduction for employer's contribution to employee's NPS account. This deduction can be claimed for up to 14% of the basic salary of an employee instead of 10% earlier.

Here is an example of how to calculate income tax payable under the new tax regime.

Suppose an individual's gross total income is Rs 20 lakh in FY 2024-25. He/she is eligible for standard deduction of Rs 75,000 in the current financial year and employer has deposited Rs 2 lakh in his/her Tier-I NPS account. This makes him eligible to claim deduction under section 80CCD (2) of the Income-tax Act.

Gross total income

Standard deduction from salary/pension
(75,000)
Deduction under section 80CCD (2)
(2,00,000)

Net taxable income
17,25,000

Hence, the net taxable income on which income tax payable is to be calculated will be Rs 17.25 lakh (Rs 20 lakh minus Rs 2.75 lakh).

Under the new income tax regime, income between 0 to Rs 3 lakh is exempted from tax. Hence, no tax will be payable on this income. After deducting income of Rs 3 lakh from Rs 17.25 lakh the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 14.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000. Thus, out of taxable income of Rs 14.25 lakh, Rs 4 lakh (Rs 7 lakh minus Rs 3 lakh) will be taxed at 5%. The tax payable here will be Rs 20,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 10.25 lakh (Rs 14.25 lakh minus Rs 4 lakh).

The next income tax slab is Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. Out of taxable income of Rs 10.25 lakh, the taxable income of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 10 lakh minus Rs 7 lakh) will be taxed at 10%. The tax payable here will be Rs 30,000. After this, the income left to be taxed will be Rs 7.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 10,00,001 and Rs 12,00,000. Out of the balance income of Rs 7.25 lakh, Rs 2 lakh will be taxed at 15%. The tax payable under this slab will be Rs 30,000. After this income left for chargeable under the tax will be Rs 5.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000. Here out of the taxable income of Rs 5.25 lakh, Rs 3 lakh (Rs 15 lakh minus Rs 12 lakh) will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable amount here will be Rs 60,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 2.25 lakh.

The final income tax slab is for incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The balance taxable income of Rs 2.25 lakh will be taxed at 30%. The tax payable here will be Rs 67,500.

The total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,07,500. In this tax amount, the cess at 4% will be added to this amount for final tax amount payable.

The final tax payable on gross income of Rs 20 lakh is Rs 2,15,800, after claiming deductions of Rs 2.75 lakh. The surcharge is also applicable if the income is above Rs 50 lakh.
How to calculate income tax liability under old tax regime
The July budget 2024 has kept the income tax slabs under the old tax regime unchanged. If a salaried taxpayer opts for the old tax regime in the current financial year 2024-25, then one can claim various deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime (which is a default tax regime) does not allow claiming various deductions and exemptions except the specified two.

By claiming deductions such as Section 80C, Section 80D, HRA tax exemption etc. one can reduce their gross taxable income and thereby reducing income tax liability.

Remember, the income tax slabs under the old tax regime has different income tax slabs depending on the age of individual in a financial year.

Here is an example on how to calculate income tax payable under the old tax regime.

Suppose an individual aged below 60 years has a gross total income of Rs 17 lakh for the current financial year, i.e., FY 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). An individual has decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year. Further, he/she is eligible to claim following tax exemption and deductions - section 80C for up to Rs 1.5 lakh, section 80CCD(1b) for NPS investment of Rs 50,000, section 80D of Rs 25,000 for medical insurance premium paid and section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 on savings account interest earned.

Section 80D – medical insurance premium
(25,000)
Section 80TTA
(10,000)
Net taxable income
14,65,000

After deducting the deductions from the gross total income, one arrives at the net taxable income of Rs 14,65,000. The tax payable will be calculated on the net taxable income.

As per the income tax slab rates table, the first Rs 2.5 lakh from net taxable income will be exempted from tax. This is because there is no tax on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh as per current income tax slabs in the old tax regime. Post this, income left on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 12,15,000 (14,65,000-2,50,000). The second slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh which is taxed at Rs 5%. This means that out of Rs 12,15,000, then next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at 5%. The tax amount will be Rs 12,500.

Now the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 9,65,000. The third slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, taxed at 20%. This means that out Rs 9,65,000, Rs 5,00,000 will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable here will be Rs 1,00,000.

The balance income on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 4,65,000. The tax amount on this balance income (Rs 14,65,000 minus Rs 10,00,000) will be calculated on the basis of the last slab, i.e., above Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 30%. The tax payable amount comes out to be Rs 1,39,500.

Hence, the total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,52,000 (Rs 12,500 + 1,00,000+ 1,39,500).

Do note that cess and surcharge are also levied on the income tax payable. Cess is levied at the rate of 4% and surcharge is levied if the total income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From the example above, the cess amount is Rs 10,080. The surcharge will not be applicable as net taxable income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh. The final tax amount payable by individual is Rs 2,62,080.
How to know which income tax slab you fall in
Individuals, not having business incomes, are required to choose between the two tax regimes in every financial year. Furthermore, an individual needs to know the income tax slabs in which their income will fall. These two factors will help an individual to determine which income tax regime is more beneficial to them.

To know the income tax slabs and rates applicable to your income under any income tax regime, one must first know the taxable income on which tax has to be calculated. If an individual continues with old tax regime, then he/she is eligible to claim tax exemption (such as House Rent Allowance exemption, Leave Travel Allowance exemption, standard deduction) and deductions under sections 80C to 80U, as eligible for. After claiming and deducting the tax exemptions and deductions that an individual is eligible for, he/she arrives at the net taxable income on which income tax payable is calculated.

For example, your gross total income from all sources is Rs 12 lakh and you are eligible to claim deduction of Rs 2.10 lakh under sections 80C, 80TTA, 80CCD(1b). The taxable income on which you have to calculate tax will be Rs 9.9 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 2.10 lakh). Your income tax slab in the old tax regime will be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The tax rate is the 20%.

However, the income tax slabs and income tax rules under the new tax regime have been revised in the July budget 2024. From April 1, 2024, the new tax regime allows standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income and Section 80CCD (2) deduction up to 14% on basic salary for employer's contribution to the employee's Tier-I NPS account.

From the example above, after claiming deduction, the taxable income is, say, Rs 9.9 lakh (Gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh minus Rs 2.10 lakh). The net taxable income of Rs 9.9 lakh falls under the revised income tax slab of Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. This will be taxed at 10%.



Surcharge on income tax
The July budget 2024 has not made any changes in the surcharge rates applicable on the income tax amounts under the new and old tax regimes. If an individual's net taxable income exceeds a specified level, then a surcharge is levied. The surcharge is levied on the income tax payable amount before the levy of cess. According to income tax laws, a surcharge is applicable if an individual's taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From FY 2023-24, the government made changes in the surcharge rates under the new tax regime. The new surcharge rates have come into effect from April 1, 2023.

Surcharge rate from April 1, 2023 under new tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Up to Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore	25%

However, individuals opting for the old tax regime in current FY 2024-25 will continue to pay the surcharge rate they were paying in the previous financial years.

Surcharge rate under old tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Upto Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore but up to Rs 5 crore	25%
More than Rs 5 crore	37%

There are certain exceptions to the surcharge rates mentioned above. If an individual has earned income from capital gains (short term or long term) through the sale of equity shares and equity mutual funds or dividend income, the surcharge will not exceed 15%, irrespective of the income range.

While understanding the concept of surcharge, one must also know the term marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief kicks in when the amount of surcharge on income tax payable exceeds the increase in income over the specified limit.

Suppose an individual has a net taxable income of Rs 51 lakh. As the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, the surcharge will be applicable at the rate of 10%. The tax payable on Rs 51 lakh (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250.

Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where the concept of marginal relief kicks in.

To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is because no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500.

Why is income tax return filing important?


The income tax department has mandated to file the return to individuals only if their income is above basic exemption limit or if they meet certain criteria like expenditure on foreign travel being more than Rs.2 lakh, the electricity consumption of Rs.1 lakh or more, deposit an amount/aggregate of an amount above Rs.1 crore in one or more current accounts in FY 2019-20 or onwards.

ITR filing is also mandatory if business receipts exceed Rs.60 lakhs, professional receipts exceed Rs.10 lakhs and TDS and TCS amount exceeds Rs.25,000.

In the case of a resident whose asset is located outside India or who has signing authority for an account-based account outside India, It is always a good idea to file your ITR even if you are not eligible due to the benefits.

ITR is required for applying for any loan in the future
ITR is required by banks even for applying credit cards
ITR is required for VISA applications, etc.
ITR is required for obtaining Term insurance

What is income tax?



Income tax is a direct tax on your income. It means a portion of your income is paid to the government. The government employs this amount for expenditures related to health, education, providing subsidies to agriculture, infrastructure etc. It is paid by an individual/HUF/any taxpayer depending on income levels or gains in a financial year. A company has to pay income tax irrespective of the level of income. The government passes laws prescribing the rate of taxation on your income from time to time.

How are taxes paid to the government?


You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return.

However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date. It’s worthwhile noting that you attract a late filing fee of Rs.5,000 on failing to file ITR within the due date of the assessment year.

Tax Slabs for AY 2025-26***
The Finance Act 2024 has amended the provisions of Section 115BAC w.e.f AY 2024-25 to make new tax regime the default tax regime for the assessee being an Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person. However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime. The old tax regime refers to the system of income tax calculation and slabs that existed before the introduction of the new tax regime. In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions.
In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).
In case of eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession, new tax regime is default regime. If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA. However, option to switch to old tax regime and withdraw the option in any subsequent AY  is available only once in lifetime for eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession.

Note: NPS has a separate section 80CCD(1B) that allows an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit of section 80C.

ELSS (Equity-Linked Saving Scheme) Mutual Fund
Let us discuss further in detail the tax-saving investment options:-

The equity-linked Saving Scheme is a tax-saving investment option under Section 80C that has two features: First, the investment amount under the ELSS scheme is allowed for tax exemption up to the maximum limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. Second, the Equity-Linked Saving Scheme investment has a lock-in period of 3 years.

The annual return offered by the ELSS funds is approximately between 5%-18% (The interest rate offered by the ELSS funds is not fixed and depends on the market performance of the underlying equities). The returns received are not constant in an equity-linked saving scheme as they vary per the fund's market performance.

This tax-saving investment scheme offers liquidity and flexibility in investment and is best suited for those ready to take risks.

The returns received from ELSS are subject to long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) at 10% if the gain exceeds Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year. However, a top ELSS fund in one period need not be the best for the next period, too. The best ELSS fund should be selected for its performance across the bull and bear market phases.

Moreover, one can track one's investment in the ELSS online simply and hassle-free.

National Pension Scheme (NPS)
As per the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the National Pension Scheme is designed to help individuals save for retirement. National Pension Scheme (NPS) is for both government and private employees. Any age group from 18-70 years can participate in the NPS program.

NPS is a good tax-saving investment option, as fund management charges are pretty low. Fund management is done under four accounts in the NPS scheme: equity, corporate bonds, government securities, and alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in assets such as venture capital, private equity, real estate, etc. These accounts help investors manage their portfolios actively or passively.

There is a tax deduction of Rs. 1,50,000/- for self-contribution to NPS, which is covered under Section 80C. Under Section 80CCD(1B), an additional deduction of Rs. 50,000 is allowed against the contribution to NPS. Therefore, this scheme provides a tax benefit of up to Rs. 2 lakh.

Employer’s NPS Contribution is covered under section 80CCD(2) of the Income Tax Act.

Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)
Unit Linked Insurance Plan is the most versatile tax-saving investment option as it allows you to invest in debt, equity, or both, according to your requirement and risk appetite. Therefore, investing in insurance is beneficial in terms of both investment and saving.

Insurance provides financial security for the whole family and a tax-free lump sum amount on maturity. The premium paid towards purchasing a life insurance policy qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, the final amount received on maturity is tax-free as per Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act.

Public Provident Fund (PPF)
PPF is a very commonly heard term among taxpayers. PPF falls under the exempt tax status, hence the reason for its popularity. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office, but they can also be transferred from one branch to another or from post office to bank and vice versa.

The amount invested during the financial year for the PPF qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The interest and the maturity amount are exempt from tax under section 10 of the Income Tax Act. The PPF account lock-in tenure is 15 years.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is one of the essential tax-saving investment options. Launched under the government’s “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” campaign, SSY focuses on improving girl-child life. The scheme allows the taxpayer to deposit some amount in the account regularly and earn interest simultaneously. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana also qualifies for deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The minimum amount is Rs.250, and the scheme matures 21 years or till the girl child gets married, whichever is earlier after the account opening.

Interest accrues on the SSY Account, which gets compounded annually, is eligible for tax exemption under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

Maturity proceeds or any withdrawal amount is also exempt from tax under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

National Savings Certificate (NSC)
National Saving Certificate is a fixed-income investment scheme that is aimed at small- and middle-income investors. NSC is a good tax-saving investment option as the risk is low and is as secure as the provident fund. Moreover, the investment in NSC qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

The interest earned is also added back to the initial investment and is eligible for tax exemption.

The features of the NSC tax-saving investment option are as follows:

A guaranteed return of 6.8% annual interest.
A tax benefit of up to Rs. 1.5Lakh
Investment can be made as low as Rs. 1,000 (or multiples of Rs. 100)
The investor will receive the entire maturity value, which will be taxed to the taxpayer.
Senior Citizen Saving Scheme
As the name suggests, the Senior Citizen Saving scheme is available to senior citizens who are residents of India. This scheme offers one of the highest rates among the various saving schemes. Although this scheme's lock-in period is five years, the depositors can extend the maturity period by another three years. Moreover, the depositors can make investments with a minimum amount of Rs.1000 and multiples thereof.

The Senior Citizen Saving Scheme investment qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C. The interest on such deposits is taxable and liable for tax if the interest exceeds Rs. 50,000.

Bank FDs
Fixed deposits are considered one of the risk-free tax saving investment schemes. The bank decides the interest rate on a minimum lock-in period of five years. In the scenario of a joint account, the primary holder can avail of the benefit of tax deduction while calculating the taxable income. Additionally, senior citizens get the maximum benefits from a higher interest rate on investment. Premature withdrawal is not allowed in the tax-saver bank fixed deposits.

Investors can claim a maximum deduction of Rs. 1.5 Lakh by investing in a tax-saving FD A/c.

Interest earned from Saving Accounts Deposits under 80 TTA
All taxpayers can avail of a tax deduction on the interest generated from savings account deposits within limits. This interest can be from savings accounts in banks, post offices, or accounts in cooperative societies involved in the banking business. This tax-saving investment option is for ordinary taxpayers, not senior citizens.

The maximum deduction limit is Rs. 10,000 under this section, which includes the interest earned from all the savings accounts one has. Beyond this limit, any interest earned will be taxable.

Under Section 80TTB, the benefit of the least tax implication on interest income is provided for a senior citizen. Under this section, a deduction up to Rs. 50,000 or an amount from a particular income is allowed from the total gross income.

Interest paid toward the repayment of the Education Loan
Under Section 80E, students who take education loans to fulfill their education dreams are offered a tax exemption on the interest repayment. There is no cap on the deduction to be claimed. Tax deduction claims can be made from the start of the year when the payer starts paying the interest on the education loan and within the seven immediately subsequent financial years or until the interest is completely paid, whichever is earlier.

Premium paid toward the Health Insurance Policies or incurred medical expenses in case of senior citizens
The total taxable income towards the premium paid on Health insurance and expenses incurred towards healthcare is allowed for tax deductions under Section 80D. The limit to claim this deduction depends on the taxpayer’s family situation:-



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Eligibility                                                   | Exemption Limit                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Health insurance for self and family (spouse and children)    | Rs. 25,000                             |
| For self and family + parents                                 | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 25,000 = Rs. 50,000   |
| For self and family (below 60 years) + Parents above 60 years | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 75,000   |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interest Paid toward Home Loan
Under Section 24 (b), interest payments toward home loans can be claimed. The maximum limit that a taxpayer gets on the interest payment of a home loan is Rs. 2 lakhs if the house property is self-occupied.

Further, in those cases where the home loan taken for the property is not self-occupied but instead is rented, there is no limit on maximum tax deductions. A deduction can be taken on the whole interest amount.

Payouts on the maturity of the Life Insurance Plan
As per section 10(10D), all the incomes received from a life insurance plan upon maturity, surrender, or death of the policyholder are tax-free.

Exemption of House Rent paid (if mentioned in salary break-up)
If there is no HRA added to your salary break-up because you work in some small, medium-sized companies. In this case, you can claim deductions on the rent paid for furnished/unfurnished accommodation as per Section 80GG. The same rule applies to self-employed people, too. The conditions to claim the deductions are:-

Must not have received HRA during any part of the fiscal year
Should not be possessing any house in the city of occupation
Individuals should not own a house in the city of occupation in the name of spouse, minor child, or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) of which the person is a member.
Owning a house in any other city different from the occupation city is eligible for deductions, but it shouldn’t be self-occupied or left vacant.
The amount of deduction under this provision exempts up to the lowest value of the listed parameters:

The rent paid more than 10% of the total income
25% of the total income after adjustment
a maximum of ₹5,000 per month.
Hence, the maximum deduction allowed during the year is ₹60,000.

Deduction of House Rent paid (if not mentioned in salary break-up)
Under Section 10(13A) Income Tax Act offers tax benefits in the minimum value of the following:-

Actual annual rent allowance disbursed by the employer
50% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) if the house is situated in metro cities or 40% of the Basic Salary plus DA if the house is situated in other cities.
Actual rent paid for the house – 10% of basic pay plus DA.
In the above calculations, DA will be considered if it forms a part of retirement benefits.

Donations made to Charitable Institutions
Deductions can be claimed for the donations made to approved charitable institutions under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. The condition is that the donation should have been made by any mode other than cash, as cash donations exceeding Rs. 2,000 do not qualify as deductions.

Further, to claim this deduction, a taxpayer needs a stamped receipt from the institution they have made the donation, with details of the name of the trust, address, PAN Number of the Trust, the amount of donation, etc.

Donations to Scientific Research and Rural Development
Taxpayers can claim deductions under Section 80GGA for the donations made for scientific research and rural development. There is no cap, and 100% of the income spent is eligible for the deduction, provided the transaction is made via a bank account if the donation exceeds Rs. 10,000/-.

Donations to Political Parties
Under Section 80GGC, the entire income spent on the donation towards political parties is waived off from tax calculations, provided the transaction is made via a bank account. Also, the political party to which the donation is made must be registered under Section 29A of the Representation of People Act (RPA) of 1951.

Medical expenses for the disabled person
Under Section 80DD, individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) can claim deductions of the amount spent for the treatment and well-being of a disabled dependent family member. However, this claim is offered only to the legal family of such dependent individuals.

Based on the percentage of disability, if people have 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If people have disabilities, more than 80% can, they claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Flat Deduction for Disabled Person on the Basis of Severity of Disability
Under Section 80U, the disabled individual can claim tax deductions if a registered medical authority documents the disability with a minimum 40% impairment.

If the disabled individual has 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If individuals have disabilities of more than 80%, they can claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Individuals Diagnosed With Specific Diseases or Disability
Under Section 80DDB, individuals can claim exemptions on subsequent income spent on the treatment of dependent family members diagnosed with specific diseases. These critical illnesses include neurological disorders, AIDS, chronic renal disease, malignant cancers, and hematological ailments. For individuals below 60, a maximum of Rs. 40,000 is disbursed, and the same increases to Rs. 1 lakh for senior and super senior citizens.

Interest Earned on Deposits by Senior Citizens
Senior citizens take a heavy charge on their finances because of the expenditure on medical expenses. Relaxation from tax deductions helps senior citizens to simplify their lives. Under Section 80 TTB, senior citizens aged 60 years and above can claim Rs. 50,000 or a specified amount as a deduction from their gross total income for that fiscal year.

Focus on long-term growth instruments such as NPS or PPF to not only save tax but also secure your retirement and long-term financial goals.

Home Loan Tax Benefit - How To Save Income Tax On Your Home Loan?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

5 min read


If you are acquiring a home by taking a loan, then you can claim deductions on interest portion that you repay as a part of EMI, in accordance with the regulations of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 

While obtaining a housing loan can be costly, it is also possible to benefit from several tax deductions that can help you save money on taxes each year. It is important to understand how to maximize these benefits.

Home Loan Tax Benefit
Impact of New Tax Regime on Home Loan Benefits
Home Loan benefits under the old tax regime remain the same as one can avail deductions without any restrictions, however, the under new tax regime benefits are curtailed, let’s know in detail about the same

Deduction under section 80C for the payment towards principal component of the home loan, stamp duty, registration charges and Section 80EE, Section 80EEA are not available
Deduction under section 24(b) for the payment towards the interest component of the home loan is not available for self-occupied property.
However, deduction under section 24b is available for let-out property. If net income from let out property results in loss, then such loss will be allowed to set off against profit from another house property but not allowed to set off against other heads of income like salary or other sources.
Deduction for Interest Paid on Housing Loan under Section 24
A loan must be taken for the purchase or construction of a house property to claim a tax deduction. If it is taken for the construction of a house, then construction must be completed within five years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken.

The interest portion of the home loan EMI for the year can be claimed as a deduction from your total income up to a maximum of Rs 2 lakh under Section 24. 

From the assessment year 2018-19 onwards, the maximum deduction for interest paid on self-occupied house property is Rs 2 lakh.

For let out property, there is no upper limit for claiming tax exemption on interest, which means that you can claim deduction on the entire interest paid on your home loan. 

In case the construction exceeds the stipulated time, i.e. 5 years, you can claim deductions on interest of home loan only up to Rs 30,000 for the financial year.

ITR Filing Last Date 2024
The last date to file Income Tax Return (ITR) for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) without a late fee is 31st July 2024.

Deduction on Interest Paid Towards Home Loan During the Pre-Construction Period
Say you bought an under-construction property and have not moved in yet but you are paying the EMIs. In this case, your eligibility to claim interest on the home loan as a deduction begins only upon completion of construction or immediately if you buy a fully constructed property. 

So, does this mean you would not enjoy any tax benefits on the interest paid during the period falling between the borrowing of loan and completion of construction? Yes, it will be available but with some conditions and in future years.

Let’s understand how. 

The Income Tax Act allows you to claim a deduction for such interest, which is also called pre-construction interest. You are allowed to deduct it in five equal instalments starting from the year the property is acquired or construction is completed, over and above the deduction you are otherwise eligible to claim from your house property income. However, the maximum eligibility remains capped at Rs 2 lakh.

For example, you availed a home loan in April 2021 for construction and paid an interest of Rs 10,000 a month. Construction of the house was completed in April 2023 after two years. Hence, you can start claiming the pre-construction interest of Rs 2.4 lakh (approx) paid by you only after the construction gets completed in five equal instalments starting from the year 2023-24. Maximum interest deduction under Section 24(b) is capped at Rs 2 lakh (including current year interest + pre-construction interest). So if you paid interest of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year 2023-24 then you can claim a total interest deduction of Rs. 1,68,000 (i.e., Rs. 1,20,000 as current year interest and Rs. 48,000 as 1/5th installment of pre-construction interest).

Further, if your home loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80EEA, you can claim an additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh over and above the limit of Rs. 2 lakhs u/s 24(b). We have discussed Section 80EEA later in this article.

Deduction on Principal Repayment under Section 80C
The principal paid on the home loan EMI for the year is allowed as a deduction under section 80C. The maximum amount that can be claimed under this section is up to Rs 1.5 lakh.

But to claim this deduction, the house property should not be sold within five years of possession. Otherwise, the deduction claimed earlier will be added back to your income in the year of sale.

Deduction for Stamp Duty and Registration Charges under Section 80C
Besides claiming the deduction for principal repayment, a deduction for stamp duty and registration charges can also be claimed under Section 80C but within the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. 

However, it can be claimed only in the year these expenses are incurred.

Additional Deduction under Section 80EE
Additional deduction under Section 80EE is allowed to the home buyers for a maximum of up to Rs 50,000. To claim this deduction, the following conditions should be met:

The amount of loan taken should be Rs 35 lakh or less, and the property’s value shall not exceed Rs 50 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2017.
And on the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first-time house owner.
Additional Deduction under Section 80EEA
To promote the housing sector, Budget 2019 has introduced an additional deduction under Section 80EEA for homebuyers for a maximum of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. 

To claim this deduction, below mentioned conditions should be met:

The stamp value of the property does not exceed Rs 45 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022 (extended from 31 March 2021)
On the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first time home buyer.
The individual should not be eligible to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA if claiming a deduction under Section 80EE.
Deduction for Joint Home Loan
If the loan is taken jointly, each loan holder can claim a deduction for home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh each and principal repayment under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh each in their tax returns.

To claim this deduction, they should also be co-owners of the property taken on loan. So, a loan taken jointly with your family member can help you claim a larger tax benefit.

Loss under the Head House Property
If you have not let-out any of your house property then there are high chances that you might incur a loss under the head house property, reason being the interest deduction that you might avail u/s 24(b). Further, even if you have rented out the property, you can incur a loss under the head house property because there is no limit on interest on home loan deductions so your interest can exceed your rental income.

About NPS
NPS, or National Pension System, is a government-sponsored pension scheme available to both salaried and self-employed individuals. It offers dual benefit:

Tax savings during your working years
A regular income stream after retirement 
NPS is one of the most popular options for individuals seeking to create a retirement corpus and a regular monthly income. The money deposited in NPS is invested in various securities and investment avenues, including the equity market. It is widely regarded as one of the cheapest investment options with equity exposure. As the returns are directly related to the market performance, there is no guarantee of any particular amount. Still, over a period of time, returns from NPS have been among the highest in the market.

Two Types of NPS Accounts
There are two types of accounts in NPS, NPS Tier 1 and NPS Tier 2.

Tier 1 Account (Pension Account):This has a fixed lock-in period until the subscriber reaches the age of 60 years. Only partial withdrawal is allowed, with certain conditions. Contributions made towards Tier 1 are tax deductible and qualify for deductions under Section 80CCD(1) and Section 80CCD(1B). This means you can invest up to Rs. 2 lakhs in an NPS Tier 1 account and claim a deduction for the full amount, i.e. Rs. 1.50 lakh under Sec 80CCD(1) and Rs. 50,000/- under Section 80CCD(1B).
Tier 2 Account (Additional Account): This is a voluntary savings account that allows subscribers to make withdrawals as and when they like. Only the contributions made by a Central government employee to a Tier 2 account are eligible for tax deduction. To open a Tier 2 account, you must open a Tier 1 account first. The deposits made in the NPS Tier II accounts are eligible for an income tax deduction, under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, for government employees. On the other hand, there is no income tax deduction offered on NPS Tier II deposits for private-sector employees and the gains in the NPS Tier 2 are taxable at the respective slab rates.
Eligibility under Section 80CCD(1B)
An individual taxpayer is eligible to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(1B) by filing the income tax return under the old tax regime. 

However, there is an age restriction for opening an NPS account. The following individuals can open NPS:

Resident individuals between 18-70 years  
Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) aged between 18-70 years. However, if NRI’s citizenship changes after investing in NPS, the scheme will be terminated. 
How to Invest in NPS to Avail Tax Benefits?
Individuals can invest in NPS online or offline. NPS account can be opened online through the NSDL e-Gov portal, now known as protean. It can also be opened offline through a financial institution acting as a Point of Presence (POP). Most banks and non-banking financial companies are authorised to act as POPs. 

Things to Note while Claiming Deductions Under Section 80CCD(1B)
Here are some of the critical points about Section 80CCD(1B) that you should be aware of:

Individuals must file their taxes under the old tax regime, i.e., opting out of the applicability of sec 115BAC(1A).
The additional deduction of Rs. 50,000/- is available only for contributions made to NPS Tier 1 accounts
Tier 2 accounts are not eligible to claim the deduction under Section 80CCD(1B)
The deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) are available to salaried individuals as well as to self-employed individuals
You need to produce documentary evidence of the transaction related to the contribution to NPS
Partial withdrawals are allowed under NPS but are subject to specific terms and conditions
The total exemption limit under Section 80CCD(1B) is Rs. 50,000/- and is independent of exemptions under Section 80C. Thereby, you can claim a maximum deduction of  Rs. 2 lakhs
In case the assessee dies and the nominee decides to close the NPS account, then the amount received by the nominee is exempt from taxation
Documents Required to Claim Tax Benefit Under NPS

The following documents are required to be submitted while investing in NPS:

Bank account statement
PAN card
Aadhaar card
Taxation on NPS Withdrawal

If partial withdrawals are made from the account, then only 25% of the contribution made is exempt from taxation. If the assessee is an employee and decides to close the NPS account or opt out of NPS, then only 40% of the total amount is tax-exempt. The assessee can withdraw 60% of the entire amount upon reaching the age of 60 as tax-free income. The remaining 40% is also tax-free if it is used to purchase an annuity plan. 

Section 80CCD(1B) offers you an excellent opportunity to save a substantial amount on your taxation liabilities. This way, you can not only reduce your present tax liabilities but also work towards creating a substantial corpus for your retirement. Remember the points mentioned above, taking any action related to your NPS account regarding Section 80CCD(1B).

Features of PPF account
Below are the essential features of PPF

Tenure: The PPF has a minimum tenure of 15 years, which can be extended in blocks of 5 years as per your wish.
Investment limits: PPF allows a minimum investment of Rs 500 and a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh for each financial year. Investments can be made in a lump sum or in a maximum of 12 instalments.
Opening balance: The account can be opened with just Rs 100 a month. Annual investments above Rs 1.5 lakh will not earn interest and will not be eligible for tax savings.
Deposit frequency: Deposits into a PPF account have to be made at least once every year for 15 years.
Mode of deposit: The deposit into a PPF account can be made either by way of cash, cheque, demand draft (DD) or through an online fund transfer.
Nomination: A PPF account holder can designate a nominee for his account either at the time of opening the account or subsequently.
Joint accounts: A PPF account can be held only in the name of one individual. Opening an account in joint names is not allowed.
Risk factor: Since PPF is backed by the Indian government, it offers guaranteed, risk-free returns as well as complete capital protection. The element of risk involved in holding a PPF account is minimal. As the returns from PPF accounts are fixed, they are used as a diversification tool for the investor’s portfolio. 
Tax benefit: The PPF interest and maturity amount are tax-free under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Partial withdrawal: PPF amount can be withdrawn partially from the 5th financial year onwards.
What is PPF Interest Rate?
The PPF interest rate for 2024-25 is 7.1% p.a., which is compounded annually. 
However, to receive the PPF interest for the deposit month, it is very important that you deposit your PPF amount within 5th of that month.


The Finance Ministry sets the interest rate every year, which is paid on 31st March. The interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the 5th day and the last day of every month. Thus, if you invest in PPF after the 5th day of the month, it will not be considered for interest calculation, and the balance which is there on the 5th day will be taken into consideration.

In a nutshell, the PPF contribution made on the 5th of a month will earn interest for that month, while any PPF contribution made after the 5th of the month will not earn interest and result in a loss of interest for that month.

PPF vs Mutual Funds
The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a savings scheme provided by the government, which offers guaranteed returns. However, there are other investment options available, such as mutual funds, that also offer tax-saving advantages. Mutual funds are investment vehicles that distribute funds among different types of assets, like stocks and bonds. They gather money from multiple investors and make strategic investments in securities.


Mutual funds have the potential to provide higher returns and greater liquidity compared to PPF. They are classified into different categories based on the asset class, such as equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. It's worth noting that only Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) among mutual funds are eligible for tax savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

Mutual funds have a proven history of delivering returns that have surpassed the market, making them a widely chosen investment option. Each category of mutual funds has its investment objective and level of risk.

Which is a Better Option: PPF or FD?
Public Provident Funds (PPF) and Fixed Deposits (FDs) provide guaranteed returns in the form of interest. However, there are significant differences between the two:

Tenure: FDs offer flexible tenures ranging from as short as 7 days to as long as 10 years, giving investors the freedom to select a duration that aligns with their preferences. On the contrary, PPF has a fixed tenure of 15 years, providing a stable and long-term savings option.

Taxation: PPF provides tax-free returns, while FDs are subject to taxation, including TDS.

Interest Rates: FD interest rates are determined by individual banks and can vary from one bank to another. Moreover, senior citizens often receive preferential treatment with higher interest rates on their FDs than regular citizens.

Loan Options: PPF allows for loans against the account, but the maximum loan amount is limited to 25% of the balance after 1 year. On the other hand, FDs also provide the option to take loans, allowing borrowers to access up to 90% of their deposit amount. The interest rate on an FD loan is usually 1-2 percentage points higher than the prevailing FD interest rate.

Loan Types: FDs can serve as collateral for different types of loans, such as home loans, business loans, and education loans, among others. The bank and the specific loan type determine the loan interest rate.

Is LIC better than Public Provident Fund?
There is often confusion regarding the difference between investment and insurance. Insurance protects against risks, while investment aims to secure a stable financial future. Investors must prioritise their financial well-being by maintaining an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses, obtaining insurance coverage for protection against accidents or unforeseen events, and saving for a secure future.

Having insurance is crucial for investors who have dependents relying on their income. There are different types of insurance schemes available, including term insurance, ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans), and endowment plans. However, it is advisable to prioritise a term insurance policy for adequate coverage and consider investing in a PPF for long-term savings.

A cost-effective approach to combining insurance and investment security is by opting for a term insurance policy along with a PPF. Rather than comparing the superiority of LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) and PPF, the emphasis should be on selecting an appropriate term policy that complements the PPF and meets your insurance needs.

Insurance plans with investment options like ULIPs can indeed have high expense ratios and hidden charges. Therefore, it is generally recommended to separate investment and insurance needs. Choosing a term insurance policy alongside investing in a PPF is a prudent strategy that allows individuals to enjoy the benefits of insurance and investment without unnecessary complexities. This approach ensures a clear and straightforward approach to meet both objectives effectively.

Public Provident Fund (PPF) Limitations
PPF accounts do have certain drawbacks that should be considered:

1. Lock-in Period: PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years, which is longer than other tax-saving investments like Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) with a lock-in period of just three years. This extended lock-in period can pose challenges in case of emergencies or when there is a need for funds during the investment period. As discussed earlier, premature withdrawals are allowed in PPF, but there are restrictions and regulations on when and how much you can withdraw. Therefore, it's important to ensure that you can commit to investing in a PPF account for 15 years.

2. Moderate Interest Rate: The interest rate offered on PPF accounts is not very high, especially considering it is a long-term investment scheme. In contrast, ELSS has the potential to provide double-digit returns to investors.

3. No Joint Holding: PPF accounts cannot be held jointly, which can be a limitation if you intend to open a joint account with your spouse or other family members.

4. Investment Limit: The maximum amount that can be invested in a PPF account in a year is ₹1.5 lakh. However, there is no limit to the amount you can invest in other tax-saving instruments like ELSS funds, NPS, or FDs, although the maximum tax benefit that can be claimed remains the same at ₹1.5 lacks under Section 80C.

5. NRI Restrictions: While resident Indians can open new PPF accounts, this option is unavailable for NRIs. If you had a PPF account as a resident Indian and have become an NRI, you can continue making deposits into the account, but you cannot open new PPF accounts.


6. Annual Contribution Requirement: PPF mandates a minimum annual contribution to keep the account active. Failing to contribute the minimum amount can lead to the account becoming inactive, and reactivating it requires paying a penalty.

Considering these drawbacks, it is important to carefully evaluate your financial goals and circumstances before investing in a PPF account.

Conclusion 
If you prefer low-risk investments and value the security provided by government-backed instruments, PPF can be a suitable choice.
