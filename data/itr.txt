Login
Login to your Cleartax account and click on ‘Start Filing’.

ITR filing page of ClearTax
Create an Account or Login with ClearTax
Create a new account or simply click on Login if you are already a user of ClearTax.

Create an account or Login
Link Your PAN
Linking your PAN allows us to submit your return to the income tax department. 

If you are filing with us for the first time, you need to link your PAN by entering your PAN, Date of Birth, and the OTP received on your registered mobile number. You can verify the OTP using either your 'Aadhaar registered mobile number' or ‘IT Department registered mobile number.’

Link your Pan to e-file
Pre-fill Your Personal Information
If you have previously filed with Cleartax and your PAN is already linked, you will directly see the autofill screen. To pre-fill your information from the income tax department, you will need to complete another OTP verification. This OTP verification is to capture all your personal information and income details in your income tax return with maximum security of your data.


If you choose the 'IT Department' option, you will need to enter two OTPs, one sent to your mobile number and the other to your email.

Too many OTPs can seem a lot of effort, but it is totally worth it! Most of your information will be auto-filled. This saves you nearly 2 hours of your time that would have been spent manually entering and correcting details. Review the auto-filled information and modify if necessary.

Pre-fill information
Upload Form 16
Scroll down and find the 'Upload Form 16' option. By uploading your Form 16, your salary details will be automatically captured. If you do not have Form 16, you can still proceed directly to e-filing by clicking on “Continue to e-file”. You can also upload multiple Form-16's if you have switched jobs in the Financial Year.

Form 16 upload
Form 16 successful

ClearTax will then automatically calculate your income along with the exemptions, deductions, etc., based on the details provided in FORM-16. You will now be redirected to this page, where you can see all your personal details, such as your name, address, bank details, etc.

Note: If you prefer skipping the pre-fill option, you can manually enter the details.

Here, you will see 4 tabs: Personal Info, Income Sources, Tax Saving and Tax Summary. 

Personal Information
All your personal details like name, address and other details will appear here. You can expand each section and review these details. You also have the option to edit them, if required. 

Personal Information 
Income Sources
Go to the ‘Income Sources’ tab. 

Salary
If you didn't upload Form 16 earlier, you can upload it here and fill in the salary details.

Salary Income
Rental Income or House property
Enter the income from house property, considering whether you occupy the house or have rented it out.

Income from House property
Capital gain
If you have sold assets like stocks, mutual funds, Gold, bonds, shares received as a part of ESOP or RSU scheme, land or building, then the profit/loss from such transactions must be reported under capital gains section. 

Capital gains

1. Stocks and Mutual Funds: 
Simply choose your stockbroker from the available options and log in to your investment account. Your capital gains will be calculated within seconds. Cleartax can effortlessly import and process thousands of transactions from your profit and loss (P&L) report to accurately determine the capital gains amount.
If you have done any intraday transactions, they will be automatically categorized as business income rather than capital gains. 
We don’t have the login option for some brokers yet, but you can directly drag and drop or upload the P&L report here. 
If your broker is not listed, you can download the excel template, fill in the required details, and upload the completed template.
For mutual funds, you should upload the P&L report from CAMS or Karvy by selecting their respective icons. You can also navigate to the "Mutual Funds" tab, where you will find CAMS, KARVY, and a few other brokers. Upload the P&L report here and your capital gains will be computed. If you have non-demat mutual funds, please upload files from both Karvy and CAMS. However, if you don't have the excel files or if your broker's name is not listed, you can manually add the details as well.
2. US or foreign stocks
A separate section is dedicated to reporting capital gain details from foreign stocks. Similar to stocks, you can either import the details directly from your broker. Currently, we support transactions from brokers like INDMoney and Vested. Even if your broker isn't mentioned, you can use our excel template to report all the transactions at once.

3. ESOPs and RSUs
If you have sold the shares received under ESOP or RSU scheme, you can add the following details under this section:

type of shares (that is, whether they are listed or not listed), 
date of purchase and sale and 
value of purchase-sale and brokerage expenses. 
Your capital gains will be calculated. 

Likewise, you can add details for all the other assets like Bonds, gold, land and buildings

Professional, Freelancing and Business Income
So broadly, there are 5 sub-sections here:

The first section is 44ADA- this is for professionals. 
The income tax law has specified a few professions and made it clear that only these professionals can opt for 44ADA: 
- Legal
- Medical
- Engineering
- Architecture
- Accountancy
- Technical Consultancy
- Interior Decoration
- Film Artists like cameraman, producer, editor, actor, director, singer, etc are specified.

Under the “Nature of Business”, you will find approximately 40 codes. Select the appropriate code. If you're unsure of the code, simply search for your profession. Also, mention the trade name and description. If you have multiple professions, you can include them all. 
The next condition here is that your revenue should be less than equal to 75 lakhs. If your revenue is more than 75 lakhs, you will have to file taxes normally and you will not be eligible to opt for the presumptive scheme. Revenue is nothing but the total amount you have received for the service offered. It is also called gross receipts. Some folks call it consultation fees. For example, if you are  a practicing lawyer and your clients pay you 1 lakh rupees towards a case, that 1 lakh would be considered as Revenue. 
The other condition is that your expenses cannot be more than 50% i.e. by default it is assumed that your expenses or cost will not be more than 50% of your income. Say your revenue is 20 lakhs, then your expenses has to be up to 10 lakhs. You can show a lower amount say 7 lakhs, then you’ll pay taxes on 13 lakhs but you cannot show a higher amount than 10 lakhs. Let’s add 12 lakhs. If you enter an incorrect amount, you will see error prompts immediately which will guide you whether you are eligible for the presumptive scheme or not. So there is no scope of mistake here.

You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.
Now let’s look at the second section, i.e. 44AD
44AD is mainly for small businesses say a private tutor, web designer, freelance content writer, small business owners. Just like there were some conditions under 44ADA, there are some conditions for 44AD too. 
- The first condition is that your turnover, i.e. nothing but your sales, must be less than 3 crores and 
- the second condition is that your profit must be more than or equal to 8% of your turnover. So if your revenue is say 1 crore, then your profit should be atleast 8 lakhs and you will have to pay taxes on this profit.
But if you have received the money through digital means, then you can pay taxes on only 6% profit instead of 8%. Even if you have received them through Phonepe or GooglePay, that would be considered as digital means. Here again, you will have to select the nature of business, trade name etc There are nearly 200 codes you can choose from.
Add the sales amount you’ve received through digital and non-digital modes separately here. The profit for digital transactions should be atleast 6% and for non-digital it should be atleast 8%. Now you can fill up the assets and liabilities details and proceed. 
There will be some freelancers who would be working independently and running unrelated small businesses too. So they can declare income under both 44AD and 44ADA, as long as the conditions are met.
If your revenue and expense conditions are not met, then you can fill in all the details under the third section. We will automatically select the correct ITR form for you, i.e. ITR-3.
You can add all your other business income here and fill up the Balance sheet and P&L
You have to fill all the Financial particulars if you have the presumptive income. You are required to disclose all the assets and liabilities associated with your business profession. Although these values do not directly affect your tax return, they must be reported as per regulations.
  - Sundry creditors refer to the outstanding amounts you were yet to receive as of March 31st, 2024, for the services you provided during the fiscal year 2023-24. Similarly, debtors are the individuals or entities to whom you owed money as of March 31st, 2024.
- A secured loan is one in which you provide collateral, such as your property or gold jewellery, as security. Other loans would be classified as unsecured.
- If you received advances as of March 31st, 2024, without having initiated or provided any services related to that payment, you should include that amount under advances.
- If you have provided advances to others, you should categorize it as an asset.
- If you use items like furniture, desktop computers, or phones for work purposes, you can list them under fixed assets.
- You can determine your bank balance as of March 31st, 2024, by referring to your passbook. Include this amount under ‘Bank Balance.’ If you remember the amount of cash you had on hand on that date, include it under ‘Cash balance.’
- Stock-in-trade represents the value of your inventory at the end of the year. This may not be applicable to you. You can enter zero and proceed.

Total business turnover/sales/gross receipts during the FY exceeds Rs 60 lakh.
Total gross receipts of the profession exceed Rs 10 lakh during the FY.
The aggregate of TDS and TCS during the FY is Rs 25000 or more (for senior citizens, there is an increased limit of Rs 50,000).
Total savings bank account deposits are Rs 50 lakh or more during the FY.
Other scenarios where it is mandatory to file ITR includes:

In the case of a resident whose asset is located outside India or has signing authority for an account based outside India. It is always good to file your ITR even if you are not eligible due to the benefits.

Filing of ITR creates a valid proof of income.
ITR is required for applying for any loan in the future.
Banks require ITR even for applying for credit cards.

What is income tax?

Income tax is a direct tax on your income. It means a portion of your income is paid to the government. The government charges this amount for expenditures related to health, education, providing subsidies to agriculture, infrastructure etc. It is paid by an individual/HUF/any taxpayer depending on income levels or gains in a financial year. A company has to pay income tax irrespective of the level of income. The government passes laws prescribing the rate of taxation on your income from time to time.

How to pay income tax online?

You have to pay your taxes before filing your tax return. If you are a salaried individual, then most of your tax liability is deducted from your salary by your employer in the form of TDS and paid to the government on your behalf. If you are liable to pay advance tax, you have to pay 90% of it before the 31st of March every financial year. You can file your ITR once the financial year ends.
The window to file ITR is generally open till the 31st of July of the relevant assessment year. However, the due date to file ITR may get extended, and the IT department will notify the same through notifications. It is always advisable to file your ITR within the due date. It’s worthwhile noting that you attract a late filing fee of Rs 5,000 on failing to file ITR within the due date of the assessment year.

What is Advance Tax?


For salaried individuals, advance tax is mostly taken care of through TDS by employers.

One's tax liability needs to be estimated beforehand. If tax amounts to more than Rs.10,000/- per year, taxpayers need to pay advance tax in quarterly instalments (June, September, December and March).

Will I get a refund if I have paid excess tax?


Yes, any excess tax paid by you can be claimed as refund by filing your Income Tax Return.

Individuals with net taxable income less than or equal to Rs 5 lakh will be eligible for tax rebate u/s 87A under the old tax regime, i.e. tax liability will be NIL.

What is Surcharge?
In case the income exceeds a certain threshold, the additional taxes are to be paid over and above existing tax rates. This is an additional tax on the High Income Earners.

15% of Income tax if total income > Rs.1 crore and < Rs.2 crore,

25% of Income tax if total income > Rs.2 crore and < Rs.5 crore,

*In Budget 2023, the highest surcharge rate of 37% has been reduced to 25% under the new tax regime. (applicable from 1st April 2023)

Therefore, the highest surcharge rate on the tax payable for such incomes will be 15%.

Here's a detailed list of exemptions and deductions available under the Old vs New Regime.

Old Tax Regime Vs New Tax Regime - Which is Better?
The new tax regime can largely benefit middle-class taxpayers who have a taxable income of up to Rs 15 lakh. The old regime is a better option for high-income earners.

The new income tax regime is beneficial for people who make low investments. As the new regime offers six lower-income tax slabs, anyone paying taxes without claiming tax deductions can benefit from paying a lower rate of tax under the new tax regime. For instance, the assessee having total income before deduction up to Rs 12 lakh will have higher tax liability under the old system if they have investments less than Rs. 3,12,500. Therefore, if you invest less in tax-saving schemes, go for the new regime.

That being said, if you already have in place a financial plan for wealth creation by making investments in tax-saving instruments; medical claims and life insurance; making payments of children’s tuition fees; payment of EMIs on education loan; buying a house with a home loan; and so on, the old regime helps you with higher tax deductions and lower tax outgo.

In light of the above and considering the new income tax regime, if taxpayers want to opt for the concessional tax rates, they may evaluate both regimes. Hence, it is advisable to do a comparative evaluation and analysis under both regimes and then choose the most beneficial one, as it may vary from person to person. Read a detailed breakdown on this topic here.

ITR stands for Income Tax Return. The central board of direct taxes (CBDT) releases all the ITR forms and specifies the procedures to be followed. This article provides an in-depth understanding of the definition of ITR and the types of ITR forms.

What is ITR?
Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form in which the taxpayers file information about their income earned and tax applicable, to the income tax department.

The department has notified 7 forms i.e. ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, ITR-4, ITR-5, ITR-6 & ITR-7 to date. Every taxpayer should file his ITR on or before the specified due date. The applicability of ITR forms varies depending on the sources of income of the taxpayer, the amount of the income earned and the category of the taxpayer like individuals, HUF, company, etc.

Which ITR should I file?
Why Should You File ITR?
If you want to claim an income tax refund from the department.
If you have earned from or have invested in foreign assets during the FY.
If you wish to apply for a visa or a loan
If the taxpayer is a company or a firm, irrespective of profit or loss.
If you have a loss from business/profession or under capital gains head, you will not be allowed to carry them forward to the next years unless you file the return before the due date.
When is it Mandatory to File Income Tax Returns (ITR) in India?
If your gross total income is more than the basic exemption limit-
Basic Exemption Limit under the old tax regime is as follows -

Age Group	Basic Exemption Limit
For individuals below 60 years	Rs 2.5 lakh
For individuals above 60 years but below 80 years	Rs 3.0 lakh
For individuals above 80 years	Rs 5.0 lakh
Irrespective of age, basic exemption limit under the new tax regime is Rs.3 Lakh.

If your income is below the basic exemption limit, you will still be required to file your tax return if you meet any of these conditions:
Deposited more than Rs 1 crore in 'current' bank account: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have deposited a total of Rs. 1 crore or more in one or more current accounts with a bank. However, no such requirement has been specified for deposits made in the post office current account; or
Deposited more than Rs 50 lakh in 'savings' bank account: You have to mandatorily file a tax return if you have deposited a total amount of Rs 50 lakh or more in one or more of your savings bank accounts.

The government introduced various incentives in the recent times to encourage the adoption of the new regime. 

These changes show that the government intends to have taxpayers transition to the new regime and eventually phase out the old one. Though the new regime is now the default tax regime, the old tax regime will continue to exist.

Budget 2025 Update
The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how!

The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows:

Note: First column contains income levels and first row contains deduction amount.

Current Tax Rates under New Tax Regime
New Tax Regime
A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D , and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in the Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes, which remain the same even for FY 2024-2025 since no changes were made in the Interim Budget 2024, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime. They are:

Higher Tax Rebate Limit: Full tax rebate on an income up to ₹7 lakhs is allowed. Whereas this threshold is ₹5 lakhs under the old tax regime. This means that taxpayers with an income of up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay any tax at all under the new tax regime! 
Streamlined Tax Slabs: The tax exemption limit is up-to ₹3 lakhs, and the new tax slabs are:

Salary income: The standard deduction of ₹50,000, which was only available under the old regime, has now been extended to the new tax regime as well. This amount has been increased to ₹75,000 for the new regime only with effect from FY 2024-25.
Family pension: Those receiving a family pension can claim a deduction of ₹15,000 or 1/3rd of the pension, whichever is lower. This amount has been increased to ₹25,000 for the new regime with effect from FY 2024-25.
Reduced Surcharge for High Net Worth Individuals: The surcharge rate on income over ₹5 crores has been reduced from 37% to 25%. This move will bring down their effective tax rate from 42.74% to 39%. 
Higher Leave Encashment Exemption: The exemption limit for non-government employees has been raised from ₹3 lakhs to ₹25 lakhs, an 8-fold increase.
Default Regime: Starting from FY 2023-24, the new income tax regime will be set as the default option. If you want to continue using the old regime, you must submit the income tax return along with Form 10-IEA before the due date. You will have the option to switch between the two regimes annually to check the tax benefits.
Old Tax Regime
The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime.

Difference Between Old Vs New Tax Regime: Which is Better for FY 2024-25?
The decision to switch to the new or remain in the old tax regime or which regime is better for you shall be based on the tax savings deductions and exemptions you are eligible for in the old tax regime. To make it easier, we have calculated a breakeven point for various income levels (refer to the table below) for a salaried individual below 60 years of age. This can be used to determine which regime to choose.

The Breakeven Threshold for Deciding Between New vs Old Tax Regimes for FY 2023-24
The Breakeven point is the amount at which there will be no difference in tax liability between the two tax regimes. 

If your total eligible deductions and exemptions in the old tax regime are higher than the breakeven threshold for your income level, it is advisable to stay in the old regime. On the other hand, if the breakeven threshold is higher, then moving to the new tax regime is more beneficial.

Tax under Old vs New Regime for FY 2024-25

When your gross total income is up-to Rs.7,00,000 (before Chapter VI-A Deductions and Standard Deduction) and you have Chapter VI A deduction of Rs.1,25,000, you won't be taxed under any of the regimes. So you can file under old or new tax regime.

How to Choose Between Old and New Tax Regimes?
When deciding between the two tax regimes, it is important to take into account the tax exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime. After deducting all eligible exemptions and deductions, the net taxable income can be determined. By calculating the tax liability based on this net taxable income under the old tax regime, it becomes possible to compare it with the tax liability under the new tax regime.

Choosing the regime with the lower tax liability is the logical approach, and it is essential to inform the employer about this choice so that the appropriate Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) can be deducted from the salary.

If you have a loss from house property, capital gains, or business & profession, you need to consider them as well while making informed decisions on the selection of regime. Along with the current year's losses, even the previous year's losses eligible to set off will get lapsed as well. Ineligibility to carry forward such losses may impact your future income determination and taxes thereon.

Conclusion
Many individuals often find themselves questioning the disparities between the old and new tax regimes. The new income tax regime is designed to accommodate those who have more personal commitments such as repayment of personal/vehicle loans, medical treatment of parents or dependents, or wish to avoid the burden of extensive tax preparation or have minimal tax deductions due to their ineligibility for section 10 exemptions, standard deductions, tax on employment, employer contribution to pension scheme etc., Conversely, the old tax regime can yield more tax savings for senior citizens, who derive a substantial portion of their income from interest, can benefit from Section 80TTB, which allows them to claim Rs.50,000 as interest income deduction and feel more secure under the old tax regime.

Both the old and new tax regimes possess advantages and disadvantages. The previous tax structure encourages taxpayers to cultivate a habit of saving, while the new tax structure favours employees with lower earnings and investments, resulting in fewer deductions and exemptions. The new tax system is considered safer and simpler, involving fewer records and reducing the potential for tax evasion fraud. However, due to the unique nature of individual deductions and exemptions, a thorough comparison of the two regimes is necessary to determine the best fit for each person.

Interest
If you submit your return after the deadline, you will be liable to pay interest at a rate of 1% per month or part month on the unpaid tax amount as per Section 234A.

Late fee
In case of late filing, Section 234F imposes a late fee of Rs.5,000, which shall be reduced to Rs.1,000 if your total income is below Rs.5 lakh.

Loss Adjustment
In case you have incurred losses from sources like the stock market, mutual funds, properties, or any of your businesses, you have the option to carry them forward and offset them against your income in the subsequent year. This provision substantially reduces your tax liability in future years. However, you will not be allowed to carry forward these losses if you miss filing your ITR before the deadline.

What if ITR Filing is Missed?
Belated Return
If you miss the ITR filing due date, you can file a return after the due date, called a belated return. However, you will still have to pay the late fee and interest charges, and you will not be allowed to carry forward any losses for future adjustments. The last date for filing a belated return is 31st December of the assessment year (unless extended by the government). 

Updated Return
Still, if you miss the 31st December deadline due to unavoidable reasons still you can file the updated (ITR U) return subject to the conditions specified therein. Click here to know more.

What are Financial Year (FY) and Assessment Year (AY)?
The return you will file in the upcoming year is for the income you earned in FY 2024-25, i.e. for the income earned between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025. The assessment year is the review year for FY 2024-2025, where you file your returns and declare your returns by declaring all the incomes, exemptions, deductions, losses etc., already made or incurred during the year for tax assessment. For the income earned during the FY (here FY 2024-25), the assessment year would be the immediately next year, i.e. 1st April 2025 to 31st March 2026. Hence, the assessment year would be AY 2025-26.

An Income Tax Refund is issued by the Income Tax Department if a taxpayer has paid more income tax than was due for the financial year. Individuals/Businesses pay income tax through TDS deducted, advance tax on the basis of anticipated liability, or self-assessment tax which might exceed the actual tax liability. In some cases, an income tax refund can also arise in case the tax liability is reduced by claiming deductions, exemptions, set off of losses, or tax credits while filing the income tax return.

Post-filing, the Income Tax Authorities assess the taxpayer's tax liability. In case the tax liability assessed exceeds the amount paid, the excess tax paid is refunded to the taxpayer along with interest at 0.5% per month or part of the month (i.e. 6% per annum) until the date of refund.

How to Calculate the Income Tax Refund with Example?
If you paid more taxes than you were required to pay, you can claim the additional amount as an income tax refund.

Income Tax Refund = Total Taxes paid – Total tax liability 

If the taxes paid (either by way of Advance Tax or TDS or TCS or Self-Assessment Tax) are more than the actual tax amount due, then the excess tax paid can be claimed as a refund. The income tax department will recompute the taxes and validate the refund claim before initiating the refund.

For example: Assume Mr. Gupta paid 3 lakh as an advance tax during the financial year. At the end of the financial year, he learns his tax liability is only 2 lakh. He can request a refund by filing an income tax return (ITR). If the assessing officer approves his request, the excess tax amount of 1 lakh will be credited to Mr Gupta's pre-validated bank account.

3 lakh Advance Tax - 2 lakh Tax liability = 1 lakh Tax refund for Mr. Gupta 

The excess amount will be refunded along with interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of the month. If the refund is received in September, then interest of Rs. 3,000 (1,00,000*0.5%*6) will also be credited to the bank account.

How to Claim an Income Tax Refund?

To get your income tax refund or TDS refund, all you need to do is file your Income Tax Return and declare your income, deduction and tax paid details to the Income Tax Department. Once the ITR is processed successfully and if there is any excess tax, it will be issued in your prevalidated bank account. Follow the process and file your ITR via Cleartax.

Process to file on Cleartax

What is the Time Duration for a Tax Refund?
The time taken to receive the income tax refund entirely depends on the Income Tax Department’s internal process. Generally, it takes around 7 to 120 days, with an average time of 90 days after you have e-verified your return. The Income Tax Department implemented a new refund processing system to enable faster refund processing with an expected turnaround of a few days instead of a few months.        
Consistent with this objective, the average ITR processing duration has been reduced to 10 days for returns submitted in the AY 2023-24, as opposed to 82 days for returns submitted in the AY 2019-20 and 16 days for returns submitted in AY 2022-23.

The Income Tax Department will send the refund amount through electronic mode (direct credit to the account) or through a ‘Refund Cheque’. You must enter the correct bank account number and IFSC code with complete address details, including the PIN code, at the time of filing your return to receive refunds. Refunds sent through cheques are dispatched to the address mentioned in the ITR through speed post.

What is the Interest on Income Tax Refund?

When the refund amount is more than 10% of the total tax payable for that particular year, you will receive a simple interest on the tax refund. Interest is computed at 6% per annum (0.5% per month or part of the month) on the refund amount. Here's how the interest on refund is computed:

Calculate interest on refund @0.5% per month

How to Claim Refund for Missed ITR Filing on Due Date?
The deadline to file your ITR for non-audit cases was 31st July 2024. However, if you cannot manage to file your taxes before the deadline, you can still file a late return, known as Belated Return.

Investment in a immovable property, predominantly house is one of the most sought-after investments primarily because you get to own a house. While others may invest with the intention of earning a profit upon selling the property in the future. It is important to note that a house property is regarded as a capital asset for income tax purposes. Consequently, any gain or loss incurred from the sale of an immovable property may be subject to tax under the 'Capital Gains' head. Similarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investments. We will delve into the chapter on ‘Capital gains’ in detail here.

What is Capital Gains Tax in India?
Any profit or gain that arises from the sale of a ‘capital asset’ is known as ‘income from capital gains’. Such capital gains are taxable in the year in which the transfer of the capital asset takes place. This is called capital gains tax. There are two types of Capital Gains: short-term capital gains(STCG) and long-term capital gains(LTCG).

Defining Capital Assets
Land, building, house property, vehicles, patents, trademarks, leasehold rights, machinery, and jewellery are a few examples of capital assets. This includes having rights in or in relation to an Indian company. It also includes the rights of management or control or any other legal right.

 The following do not come under the category of capital asset:

a. Any stock, consumables or raw material, held for the purpose of business or profession

b. Personal goods such as clothes and furniture held for personal use

c. Agricultural land in rural(*) India

d. 6½% gold bonds (1977) or 7% gold bonds (1980) or National Defence gold bonds (1980) issued by the central government

e. Special bearer bonds (1991)

f. Gold deposit bond issued under the gold deposit scheme (1999) or deposit certificates issued under the Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2015 and Gold Monetisation Scheme, 2019 notified by the Central Government.

*Definition of rural area (effective from AY 2014-15) – Any area which is outside the jurisdiction of a municipality or cantonment board, having a population of 10,000 or more is considered a rural area. Also, it should not fall within a distance given below

2

> 2 kms but < 6 kms

> 1,00,000

3

> 6 kms but < 8 kms

> 10,00,000

 


Types of Capital Assets?
1. STCA ( Short-term capital asset ) An asset held for a period of 24 months or less is a short-term capital asset. So, if you sell the asset within a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a short-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the holding period is reduced to 24 months and 12 months. 

Some assets are considered short-term capital assets when these are held for 12 months or less. This rule is applicable if the date of transfer is after 10th July 2014 (irrespective of what the date of purchase is). These assets are:

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
2. LTCA ( Long-term capital asset ): An asset held for more than 24 months is a long-term capital asset. They will be classified as a long-term capital asset if held for more than 24 months as earlier. So, if you sell the asset after a period of 24 months of purchasing, then it would be called as a long-term capital asset. However, in some of the assets, the applicable holding period is 12 months. 

Capital assets such as land, building and house property shall be considered as long-term capital asset if the owner holds it for a period of 24 months or more (from FY 2017-18).

Whereas, below-listed assets if held for a period of more than 12 months, shall be considered as long-term capital asset.

Equity or preference shares in a company listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Securities (like debentures, bonds, govt securities etc.) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India
Units of UTI, whether quoted or not
Units of equity oriented mutual fund, whether quoted or not
Zero coupon bonds, whether quoted or not
Note: Capital gains from the sale of units of a specified mutual fund acquired on or after April 1, 2023, and market-linked debentures will always be treated as short-term capital gains, regardless of how long they have been held.

From the above example, it is clear that the changes in income tax rules will have a positive impact on the people if it is held for shorter period but if it is held for a longer period the indexation benefit will be foregone and it will lead to negative impact for the taxpayer.

Calculating Capital Gains
Capital gains are calculated differently for assets held for a longer period and for those held over a shorter period.

Terms You Need to Know:
Full value consideration: The consideration received or to be received by the seller as a result of transfer of his capital assets. Capital gains are chargeable to tax in the year of transfer, even if no consideration has been received.

Cost of acquisition: The value for which the capital asset was acquired by the seller.   
Cost of improvement: Expenses of a capital nature incurred in making any additions or alterations to the capital asset by the seller.

Note:

In certain cases where the capital asset becomes the property of the taxpayer otherwise than by an outright purchase by the taxpayer, the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement incurred by the previous owner would also be included.
Improvements made before April 1, 2001, is never taken into consideration.
How to Calculate Short-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Cost of acquisition
Cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54B/54D

Step 4: This amount is a short-term capital gain to be taxed

Short-term capital gain =	Full value consideration   
Less: Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer( for e.g. brokerage on sale)   
Less: Cost of acquisition   
Less: Cost of improvement
How to Calculate Long-Term Capital Gains?
Step 1: Start with the full value of consideration

Step 2: Deduct the following:

Expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer
Indexed cost of acquisition
Indexed cost of improvement
Step 3: From this resulting number, deduct exemptions provided under sections 54, 54D, 54EC, 54F, and 54B 

Long-term capital gain=	Full value consideration   
Less : Expenses incurred exclusively for such transfer   
Less: Indexed cost of acquisition   
Less: Indexed cost of improvement   
Less: Expenses that can be deducted from full value for consideration*
(*Expenses from sale proceeds from a capital asset, that wholly and directly relate to the sale or transfer of the capital asset are allowed to be deducted. These are the expenses which are necessary for the transfer to take place.)

Exception: 

Long-term capital gains on the sale of equity shares/ units of equity oriented fund, realised after 31st March 2018, will remain exempt up to Rs. 1.25 lakh per annum.
If the transfer happened on or before 23/07/2024, tax at @ 10% will be levied only on LTCG on shares/units of equity oriented fund exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh in one financial year without the benefit of indexation.
If the transfer happened after 23/07/2024, tax rate is 12.5%. Exemption of Rs. 1.25 Lakh available.
Deductible Expenses
A. Sale of house property: These expenses are deductible from the total sale price:

Brokerage or commission paid for securing a purchaser
Cost of stamp papers
Travelling expenses in connection with the transfer – these may be incurred after the transfer has been affected
Where property has been inherited, expenditure incurred with respect to procedures associated with the will and inheritance, obtaining succession certificate, costs of the executor, may also be allowed in some cases
B. Sale of shares: You may be allowed to deduct these expenses:

Broker’s commission related to the shares sold
STT or securities transaction tax is not allowed as a deductible expense
C. Where jewellery is sold: In case of sale of broker’s jewellery and where a broker’s services were involved in securing a buyer, the cost of these services can be deducted.

Note: The expenses deducted from the sale price of assets for calculating capital gains are not allowed as a deduction under any other head of income, and you can claim them only once.

Indexed Cost of Acquisition/Improvement
The cost of acquisition and improvement is indexed by applying CII (cost inflation index). It is done to adjust for inflation over the years of holding the asset. This increases one’s cost base and lowers the capital gains.   
Refer to this page for the complete list of CII.  

The indexed cost of acquisition is calculated as:

Indexed cost of   
acquisition =	(Cost of acquisition X   
CII of the year in which the asset is transferred ) /   
CII of the year in which the asset was first held by the seller or FY 2001-02, whichever is later   
 
The cost of acquisition of the assets acquired before 1st April 2001 should be actual cost or FMV as on 1st April 2001, as per taxpayer’s option.

The indexed cost of improvement is calculated as:

Indexed cost of improvement =	Cost of improvement x CII (year of asset transfer) / CII (year of asset improvement)
Note: Improvements made before 1st April 2001, should not be considered.

Note: The indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. However, this faced a backlash from the public. So, the Government has passed an amendment that allows taxpayers to compute taxes either at 12.5 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation on real estate transactions. The amendment will apply not only to real estate transactions but also to unlisted equity transactions, which are done before July 23, 2024.

Exemption on Capital Gains
Example: Manya bought a house in July 2004 for Rs.50 lakh, and the full value of consideration received in FY 2016-17 is Rs.1.8 crore.   
Capital asset type: Since this property has been held for over 2 years, this would be a long-term capital asset.

Cost of acquisition: The cost price is adjusted for inflation and indexed cost of acquisition is taken. Using the indexed cost of acquisition formula, the adjusted cost of the house is Rs 1.17 crore. (Refer CII here for the calculations)

Capital gain: Hence, the net capital gain is Rs 63, 00,000.

Tax: Long-term capital gains on sale of house property are taxed at 20%. For a net capital gain of Rs 63, 00,000, the total tax outgo will be Rs.12,97,800.

This is a significant amount of money to be paid out in taxes. This can be lowered by taking benefit of exemptions provided by the Income Tax Act on capital gains when profit from the sale is reinvested into buying another asset.

Section 54: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Purchase of Another House Property
Budget 2019 announcement!  

Capital gains exemption under Section 54: Taxpayers can get an exemption from long-term capital gain from the sale of house property by investing in up to two house properties against the earlier provision of one house property with same conditions. However, the capital gain on the sale of house property must not exceed Rs 2 crores.

The exemption under Section 54 is available when the capital gains from the sale of house property are reinvested into buying or constructing two another house properties (prior to Budget 2019, the exemption of the capital gains was limited to only 1 house property).

The exemption on two house properties will be allowed once in the lifetime of a taxpayer, provided the capital gains do not exceed Rs. 2 crores. The taxpayer has to invest the amount of capital gains and not the entire sale proceeds. If the purchase price of the new property is higher than the amount of capital gains, the exemption shall be limited to the total capital gain on sale.

Conditions for availing this benefit:

The new property can be purchased either 1 year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property.
The gains can also be invested in the construction of a property, but construction must be completed within three years from the date of sale.
In the Budget for 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the capital gains to claim this exemption.
Please note that this exemption can be taken back if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase/completion of construction.
The capital gains tax exemption limit under Section 54 to 54F is restricted to Rs.10 crore. Earlier, there was no threshold.

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  

If the amount of capital gain exceeds Rs. 2 Crore  then One residential house property should be purchased within 1 year before the date of sale of house property or 2 years after the date of sale of house property; (OR) Construct a house property within 3 years after the date of sale of house property.

Section 54F: Exemption on capital gains on sale of any asset other than a house property
Exemption under Section 54F is available when there are capital gains from the sale of a long-term asset other than a house property. You must invest the entire sale consideration and not only capital gain to buy a new residential house property to claim this exemption. Purchase the new property either one year before the sale or 2 years after the sale of the property. You can also use the gains to invest in the construction of a property. However, the construction must be completed within 3 years from the date of sale.

In Budget 2014-15, it has been clarified that only 1 house property can be purchased or constructed from the sale consideration to claim this exemption. This exemption can be taken back, if this new property is sold within 3 years of its purchase. If the entire sale proceeds are invested towards the new house, the entire capital gain will be exempt from taxes if you meet the above-said conditions.

However, if you invest a portion of the sale proceeds, the capital gains exemption will be in the proportion of the invested amount to the sale price LTCG exemption = Capital gains x Cost of new house / Net consideration.

Section 54EC: Exemption on Sale of House Property on Reinvesting in specific bonds
Exemption is available under Section 54EC when capital gains from sale of the first property are reinvested into specific bonds.

If you are not keen to reinvest your profit from the sale of your first property into another one, then you can invest them in bonds for up to Rs. 50 lakhs issued by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
The money invested can be redeemed after 5 years, but they cannot be sold before the lapse of 5 years from the date of sale.
The homeowner has six month’s time to invest the profit in these bonds. But to be able to claim this exemption, you will have to invest before the tax filing deadline.
Section 54B: Exemption on Capital Gains From Transfer of Land Used for Agricultural Purpose
When you make short-term or long-term capital gains from transfer of land situated in Urban area used for agricultural purposes – by an individual or the individual’s parents or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) – for 2 years before the sale, exemption is available under Section 54B. The exempted amount is the investment in a new asset or capital gain, whichever is lower. You must reinvest into a new agricultural land (in urban or rural area) within 2 years from the date of transfer. 

The new agricultural land, which is purchased to claim capital gains exemption, should not be sold within a period of 3 years from the date of its purchase. In case you are not able to purchase agricultural land before the date of furnishing of your income tax return, the amount of capital gains must be deposited before the date of filing of return in the deposit account in any branch (except rural branch) of a public sector bank or IDBI Bank according to the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

Exemption can be claimed for the amount which is deposited. If the amount which was deposited as per Capital Gains Account Scheme was not used for the purchase of agricultural land, it shall be treated as capital gains of the year in which the period of 2 years from the date of sale of land expires.

Section 54D: Capital Gains on transfer of  land and building which is used for  industrial undertaking 
Conditions to be fulfilled :

There must be compulsory purchase of land and building which is used for an industrial undertaking.
The land and building should have been used by the assessee for purposes of the business of the industrial undertaking in the 2 years before the date of transfer.
The assessee must purchase any other land or building or construct any building (for shifting or re-establishing the existing undertaking or setting up a new industrial undertaking) within 3 years from the date of transfer.
If such investment is not made before the date of filing of return of income, then the capital gain has to be deposited under the CGAS.
Amount of exemption :

If the cost of a new asset is more than or equal to the sale consideration, then the entire capital gain will be exempted.
If the cost of a new asset is lesser than Capital gains, capital gains to the extent of the cost of a new asset is exempt. i.e. the cost of a new asset will be exempted.
When can you invest in Capital Gains Account Scheme?
Finding a suitable seller, arranging the requisite funds and getting the paperwork in place for a new property is one time-consuming process. Fortunately, the Income Tax Department agrees with these limitations. If capital gains have not been invested until the due date of filing of return (usually 31 July) of the financial year in which the property is sold, the gains can be deposited in a PSU bank or other banks as per the Capital Gains Account Scheme, 1988.

This deposit can then be claimed as an exemption from capital gains, and no tax has to be paid on it. However, if the money is not invested, the deposit shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in the year in which the specified period lapses.

Saving Tax on Sale of Agricultural Land
In some cases, capital gains made from the sale of agricultural land may be entirely exempt from income tax or it may not be taxed under the head capital gains. See below:

a. Agricultural land in a rural area in India is not considered a capital asset and therefore any gains from its sale are not chargeable to tax. For details on what defines an agricultural land in a rural area, see above.

b. Do you hold agricultural land as stock-in-trade? If you are into buying and selling land regularly or in the course of your business, in such a case, any gains from its sale are taxable under the head Business and Profession.

c. Capital gains on compensation received for compulsory acquisition of urban agricultural land are tax exempt under Section 10(37) of the Income Tax Act.

If your agricultural land wasn’t sold in any of the above cases, you can seek exemption under Section 54B.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is the benefit of indexation available for computing capital gains arising on sale of a short-term capital asset?


Capital gains is determined by reducing the purchase price from the sale price. However, for an asset that has been held for a long time, it would not be appropriate to determine gains by merely reducing purchase price from sale price without giving any effect to the inflation. Hence, the concept of indexing the purchase price has been brought in. This way, the indexed purchase price can be reduced from sale price to determine gains. So, indexation applies only to assets held for long-term.

Should an NRI pay taxes on gains made on the sale of property in India?


Property sold in India is generally subject to tax deduction. The person buying the property must deduct taxes at the rate applicable to the NRI’s income slab, if the property is a short-term asset. If the property is a long-term asset, 20% LTCG tax is charged. Further, it is important for the NRI to ensure that taxes are deducted on the gains made and not on the sale proceeds. A jurisdictional Assessing Officer can help to determine the gains on which taxes should be deducted by the purchaser.

Can I set off my short-term capital loss against any other head of income?


First and foremost, capital losses can be set off only against capital gains. Accordingly, short-term capital losses can be set off against any income under capital gains be it short-term or long-term. However, long-term capital losses can be set off only against long-term capital gains.

Form 10-IEA is a declaration made by the return filers for choosing the ‘Opting Out of New Tax Regime’. An Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person with business or professional income must submit Form 10-IEA if they wish to pay income tax as per the old tax regime. On the other hand, taxpayers who do not have income from business or profession can simply tick the “Opting out of new regime” in the ITR form without the need to file Form 10-IEA. Simply put, only those who file ITR-3, ITR-4 or ITR-5 have to submit Form 10-IEA if they have business income (other than coop societies). Individuals and HUFs filing their returns in Forms ITR-1 or 2 are not required to submit Form 10-IEA.

 

 

I am filing ITR in new regime for AY 2024-25. Can I switch between old and new tax regime in the next years?
An Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person with business or professional income will not be eligible to choose between the two regimes every year. Once they opt out of new tax regime, they have only one chance for switching to new regime. Once they switch back to the new regime, they won’t be able to choose old regime anytime in future. An individual with non business income can switch between the new and old tax regimes every year. Within the same year, again it is emphasized that the choice of old tax regime can be made only before the due date of filing the return u/s 139(1) of I T Act.

 

 

I am having business income and have opted in and opted out from the new regime in the previous years. So, will I be in old regime for the AY 2024-25?
Please note that new tax regime is default regime for AY 2024-25. Any actions in any previous years with respect to choice of regimes will not be applicable from AY 2024-25. You are required to submit Form 10-IEA again in case you want to opt for the old regime.

 

 

I have business income, I have wrongly filed Form 10-IEA but want to file the return under new tax regime. As there is no option to withdraw Form 10-IEA in that case whether my return can be filed under new tax regime?
Once Form 10IEA is filed for AY 2024-25, then it cannot be revoked / withdrawn in same AY. If you wish to re-enter into new tax regime then you can file Form 10IEA for withdrawal option in the next assessment year. Again it is emphasised that that the choice of old tax regime can be made only before the due date of filing the return u/s 139(1) of IT Act.

 

 

I am filing ITR-5. I want to opt out of new tax regime? Whether Form 10-IFA or Form 10- IEA would be applicable to me?
Form 10-IEA is applicable to AOP’s (other than Co-operative society) or BOI or AJP, who are filing return of Income in ITR-5 for AY 2024-25.

Form 10-IFA is applicable to new manufacturing co-operative Societies resident in India filing ITR 5, if they wish to avail New Tax Regime under Section 115BAE for AY 2024-25.

How to calculate income tax payable under new tax regime
For those salaried individuals who are continuing with the new tax regime for the current financial year, 2024-25, should know how to calculate income tax payable. It is important to remember that income tax slabs have been tweaked in new tax regime. Hence, knowing the correct way to calculate is important.

Further, for FY 2024-25, deductions available under new tax regime for a salaried individual have also been tweaked. A salaried individual can claim - i) Standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income instead of Rs 50,000 earlier, and ii) Section 80CCD (2) deduction for employer's contribution to employee's NPS account. This deduction can be claimed for up to 14% of the basic salary of an employee instead of 10% earlier.

Here is an example of how to calculate income tax payable under the new tax regime.

Suppose an individual's gross total income is Rs 20 lakh in FY 2024-25. He/she is eligible for standard deduction of Rs 75,000 in the current financial year and employer has deposited Rs 2 lakh in his/her Tier-I NPS account. This makes him eligible to claim deduction under section 80CCD (2) of the Income-tax Act.

Net taxable income
17,25,000

Hence, the net taxable income on which income tax payable is to be calculated will be Rs 17.25 lakh (Rs 20 lakh minus Rs 2.75 lakh).

Under the new income tax regime, income between 0 to Rs 3 lakh is exempted from tax. Hence, no tax will be payable on this income. After deducting income of Rs 3 lakh from Rs 17.25 lakh the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 14.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 3,00,001 and Rs 7,00,000. Thus, out of taxable income of Rs 14.25 lakh, Rs 4 lakh (Rs 7 lakh minus Rs 3 lakh) will be taxed at 5%. The tax payable here will be Rs 20,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 10.25 lakh (Rs 14.25 lakh minus Rs 4 lakh).

The next income tax slab is Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. Out of taxable income of Rs 10.25 lakh, the taxable income of Rs 3 lakh (Rs 10 lakh minus Rs 7 lakh) will be taxed at 10%. The tax payable here will be Rs 30,000. After this, the income left to be taxed will be Rs 7.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 10,00,001 and Rs 12,00,000. Out of the balance income of Rs 7.25 lakh, Rs 2 lakh will be taxed at 15%. The tax payable under this slab will be Rs 30,000. After this income left for chargeable under the tax will be Rs 5.25 lakh.

The next income tax slab is Rs 12,00,001 and Rs 15,00,000. Here out of the taxable income of Rs 5.25 lakh, Rs 3 lakh (Rs 15 lakh minus Rs 12 lakh) will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable amount here will be Rs 60,000. After this, the income left to be taxed is Rs 2.25 lakh.

The final income tax slab is for incomes above Rs 15 lakh. The balance taxable income of Rs 2.25 lakh will be taxed at 30%. The tax payable here will be Rs 67,500.

The total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,07,500. In this tax amount, the cess at 4% will be added to this amount for final tax amount payable.

How to calculate income tax liability under old tax regime
The July budget 2024 has kept the income tax slabs under the old tax regime unchanged. If a salaried taxpayer opts for the old tax regime in the current financial year 2024-25, then one can claim various deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime (which is a default tax regime) does not allow claiming various deductions and exemptions except the specified two.

By claiming deductions such as Section 80C, Section 80D, HRA tax exemption etc. one can reduce their gross taxable income and thereby reducing income tax liability.

Remember, the income tax slabs under the old tax regime has different income tax slabs depending on the age of individual in a financial year.

Here is an example on how to calculate income tax payable under the old tax regime.

Suppose an individual aged below 60 years has a gross total income of Rs 17 lakh for the current financial year, i.e., FY 2024-25 (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). An individual has decided to opt for the old tax regime for the current financial year. Further, he/she is eligible to claim following tax exemption and deductions - section 80C for up to Rs 1.5 lakh, section 80CCD(1b) for NPS investment of Rs 50,000, section 80D of Rs 25,000 for medical insurance premium paid and section 80TTA of Rs 10,000 on savings account interest earned.

Net taxable income
14,65,000

After deducting the deductions from the gross total income, one arrives at the net taxable income of Rs 14,65,000. The tax payable will be calculated on the net taxable income.

As per the income tax slab rates table, the first Rs 2.5 lakh from net taxable income will be exempted from tax. This is because there is no tax on income up to Rs 2.5 lakh as per current income tax slabs in the old tax regime. Post this, income left on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 12,15,000 (14,65,000-2,50,000). The second slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh which is taxed at Rs 5%. This means that out of Rs 12,15,000, then next Rs 2,50,000 will be taxed at 5%. The tax amount will be Rs 12,500.

Now the income left which is still chargeable to tax is Rs 9,65,000. The third slab in the income tax slab table is Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, taxed at 20%. This means that out Rs 9,65,000, Rs 5,00,000 will be taxed at 20%. The tax payable here will be Rs 1,00,000.

The balance income on which tax has to be calculated is Rs 4,65,000. The tax amount on this balance income (Rs 14,65,000 minus Rs 10,00,000) will be calculated on the basis of the last slab, i.e., above Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 30%. The tax payable amount comes out to be Rs 1,39,500.

Hence, the total tax payable by an individual will be Rs 2,52,000 (Rs 12,500 + 1,00,000+ 1,39,500).

Do note that cess and surcharge are also levied on the income tax payable. Cess is levied at the rate of 4% and surcharge is levied if the total income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From the example above, the cess amount is Rs 10,080. The surcharge will not be applicable as net taxable income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh. The final tax amount payable by individual is Rs 2,62,080.
How to know which income tax slab you fall in
Individuals, not having business incomes, are required to choose between the two tax regimes in every financial year. Furthermore, an individual needs to know the income tax slabs in which their income will fall. These two factors will help an individual to determine which income tax regime is more beneficial to them.

To know the income tax slabs and rates applicable to your income under any income tax regime, one must first know the taxable income on which tax has to be calculated. If an individual continues with old tax regime, then he/she is eligible to claim tax exemption (such as House Rent Allowance exemption, Leave Travel Allowance exemption, standard deduction) and deductions under sections 80C to 80U, as eligible for. After claiming and deducting the tax exemptions and deductions that an individual is eligible for, he/she arrives at the net taxable income on which income tax payable is calculated.

For example, your gross total income from all sources is Rs 12 lakh and you are eligible to claim deduction of Rs 2.10 lakh under sections 80C, 80TTA, 80CCD(1b). The taxable income on which you have to calculate tax will be Rs 9.9 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 2.10 lakh). Your income tax slab in the old tax regime will be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. The tax rate is the 20%.

However, the income tax slabs and income tax rules under the new tax regime have been revised in the July budget 2024. From April 1, 2024, the new tax regime allows standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary and pension income and Section 80CCD (2) deduction up to 14% on basic salary for employer's contribution to the employee's Tier-I NPS account.

From the example above, after claiming deduction, the taxable income is, say, Rs 9.9 lakh (Gross taxable income of Rs 12 lakh minus Rs 2.10 lakh). The net taxable income of Rs 9.9 lakh falls under the revised income tax slab of Rs 7,00,001 and Rs 10,00,000. This will be taxed at 10%.



Surcharge on income tax
The July budget 2024 has not made any changes in the surcharge rates applicable on the income tax amounts under the new and old tax regimes. If an individual's net taxable income exceeds a specified level, then a surcharge is levied. The surcharge is levied on the income tax payable amount before the levy of cess. According to income tax laws, a surcharge is applicable if an individual's taxable income exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

From FY 2023-24, the government made changes in the surcharge rates under the new tax regime. The new surcharge rates have come into effect from April 1, 2023.

Surcharge rate from April 1, 2023 under new tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Up to Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore	25%

However, individuals opting for the old tax regime in current FY 2024-25 will continue to pay the surcharge rate they were paying in the previous financial years.

Surcharge rate under old tax regime
Income range	Surcharge rate
Upto Rs 50 lakh	Nil
More than Rs 50 lakh but up to Rs 1 crore	10%
More than Rs 1 crore but up to Rs 2 crore	15%
More than Rs 2 crore but up to Rs 5 crore	25%
More than Rs 5 crore	37%

There are certain exceptions to the surcharge rates mentioned above. If an individual has earned income from capital gains (short term or long term) through the sale of equity shares and equity mutual funds or dividend income, the surcharge will not exceed 15%, irrespective of the income range.

While understanding the concept of surcharge, one must also know the term marginal relief. The concept of marginal relief kicks in when the amount of surcharge on income tax payable exceeds the increase in income over the specified limit.

Suppose an individual has a net taxable income of Rs 51 lakh. As the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, the surcharge will be applicable at the rate of 10%. The tax payable on Rs 51 lakh (without surcharge) is Rs 13,42,500. The surcharge amount will be Rs 1,34,250.

Here the surcharge amount (Rs 1,34,250) is higher than the additional income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1,00,000). This is where the concept of marginal relief kicks in.

To know the amount of marginal relief that is applicable, one needs to calculate income tax payable on Rs 50 lakh. This is because no surcharge will be applicable till the income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. The income tax payable will be Rs 13,12,500. Now add income above Rs 50 lakh (Rs 1 lakh) to the income tax payable amount. The tax payable amount under marginal relief will be Rs 14,12,500.

To ascertain the actual income tax payable with surcharge, compare the normal tax liability (before surcharge and cess) and tax liability after marginal tax relief (without cess). Normal tax liability is Rs 13,42,500 and tax liability after marginal tax relief is Rs 14,12,500. The surcharge that will be applicable is Rs 70,000 (Rs 14,12,500 - Rs 13,42,500).

The final tax payable amount will be Rs 13,42, 500 (Tax payable amount) + Rs 70,000 (Surcharge) + Rs 56,500 (Cess at 4% on Rs 14,12,500) = Rs 14,69,000.

Effective from April 1, 2020 (FY 2020-21), an individual has an option to continue with the old tax regime (claim deductions and tax exemptions) or opt for the new tax regime without any deductions and tax exemptions. The new tax regime when announced was optional in nature and was offering lower tax rate as compared to the old tax regime. However, from FY 2023-24, the new tax regime has become default option. If no tax regime is chosen by the individual, then income tax payable will be calculated using new tax regime now.

Here are latest income tax slabs and rates applicable for FY 2020-21 (AY 2021-22), FY 2021- 22 (AY 2022-23) and FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24)

How to file an income tax return after the due date?


The due date to file ITR is July 31st. If you miss filing your ITR within the deadline, you can file a belated return or updated return. However, a late filing fee and interest will be applicable. Penalty in terms of additional taxes is also applicable in case of updated return.

How to file an income tax return for previous years?


You can file the ITR of previous years using updated return (ITR U form). Nevertheless, there are certain restrictions on eligibility and the number of years for which ITR-U can be used. For comprehensive information, refer to this article.

How to check if ITR is filed?


Step 1: Log in to the e-filing portal with your user ID and password.
If your PAN is not linked with Aadhaar, a pop-up message will indicate its inoperability. Link PAN with Aadhaar by clicking "Link Now" or continue without linking.
Step 2: Go to e-File > Income Tax Returns > View Filed Returns.
Step 3: View all your filed returns on the page. Use "Filter" to sort returns based on criteria like Assessment Year or Filing Type. Click "View Details" and you will be able to see the status of your ITR in the form of a return's life cycle along with action items (e.g., pending e-Verification).
Note: If PAN is inoperative, refund issuance will be on hold until linked.

What will happen if I have missed the due date or made a mistake while filing my Income Tax Return?


I missed the deadline: You can file a belated return before 31st December of the AY, i.e. For FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), the filing date of it would be till 31st Dec 2024. (It is called a belated return, i.e., a late-filed return with the payment of late fees u/s 234F).

I made a Mistake: You can revise your already filed ITR before 31st December of the AY, i.e. For FY 2022-23 (AY 2023-24), the filing date of it would be till 31st Dec 2023.

If you missed the 31st Dec 2023 deadline, file the Updated return (ITR U) within the additional time limit only if the specified conditions are met.

I have filed my return. When will I get a refund?


Usually, it takes 30-90 days to get your refund after filing your Income Tax Return. You can track the refund check status from here.

Is it necessary to attach documents while e-filing ITR?


No, documents are not required to be attached/ uploaded, but you are advised to keep them with you. Income tax authorities may ask them if any assessment notice is served to you in future.

What are the consequences of non e-verifying income tax return?


It is required to either e-verify the return or send it by making the signature physically to CPC, Income Tax Department, Bengaluru within 30 days of filing the return. Failing to do so will result in invalidation of return, which means the return will be considered as having never been filed.

If the return is verified after 30 days, the date of e-verification will be considered as the date of filing, and if such date falls after the due date, then

the late filing fees of Rs.5000/Rs.1000 will be levied.
The tax regime shall be switched to the default regime, and the return will be processed. (For FY 2023-24, if the new tax regime was opted out, then the return will be processed under the new tax regime (default regime) by disallowing the ineligible exemptions and deductions.

Tax Slabs for AY 2025-26***
The Finance Act 2024 has amended the provisions of Section 115BAC w.e.f AY 2024-25 to make new tax regime the default tax regime for the assessee being an Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person. However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime. The old tax regime refers to the system of income tax calculation and slabs that existed before the introduction of the new tax regime. In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions.
In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).
In case of eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession, new tax regime is default regime. If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA. However, option to switch to old tax regime and withdraw the option in any subsequent AY is available only once in lifetime for eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession.

However, to make the new tax regime more attractive, the tax rebate was increased to Rs 25,000 for New Tax regime only. This made zero tax payable for taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh in the new tax regime for FY 2023-24 (from April 1, 2023).

However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime. The old tax regime refers to the system of income tax calculation and slabs that existed before the introduction of the new tax regime. In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions.
In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1).

If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA.

Note: NPS has a separate section 80CCD(1B) that allows an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh limit of section 80C.

ELSS (Equity-Linked Saving Scheme) Mutual Fund
Let us discuss further in detail the tax-saving investment options:-

The equity-linked Saving Scheme is a tax-saving investment option under Section 80C that has two features: First, the investment amount under the ELSS scheme is allowed for tax exemption up to the maximum limit of Rs.1.5 lakh. Second, the Equity-Linked Saving Scheme investment has a lock-in period of 3 years.

The annual return offered by the ELSS funds is approximately between 5%-18% (The interest rate offered by the ELSS funds is not fixed and depends on the market performance of the underlying equities). The returns received are not constant in an equity-linked saving scheme as they vary per the fund's market performance.

This tax-saving investment scheme offers liquidity and flexibility in investment and is best suited for those ready to take risks.

The returns received from ELSS are subject to long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) at 10% if the gain exceeds Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year. However, a top ELSS fund in one period need not be the best for the next period, too. The best ELSS fund should be selected for its performance across the bull and bear market phases.

Moreover, one can track one's investment in the ELSS online simply and hassle-free.

National Pension Scheme (NPS)
As per the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the National Pension Scheme is designed to help individuals save for retirement. National Pension Scheme (NPS) is for both government and private employees. Any age group from 18-70 years can participate in the NPS program.

NPS is a good tax-saving investment option, as fund management charges are pretty low. Fund management is done under four accounts in the NPS scheme: equity, corporate bonds, government securities, and alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in assets such as venture capital, private equity, real estate, etc. These accounts help investors manage their portfolios actively or passively.

There is a tax deduction of Rs. 1,50,000/- for self-contribution to NPS, which is covered under Section 80C. Under Section 80CCD(1B), an additional deduction of Rs. 50,000 is allowed against the contribution to NPS. Therefore, this scheme provides a tax benefit of up to Rs. 2 lakh.

Employer’s NPS Contribution is covered under section 80CCD(2) of the Income Tax Act.

Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)
Unit Linked Insurance Plan is the most versatile tax-saving investment option as it allows you to invest in debt, equity, or both, according to your requirement and risk appetite. Therefore, investing in insurance is beneficial in terms of both investment and saving.

Insurance provides financial security for the whole family and a tax-free lump sum amount on maturity. The premium paid towards purchasing a life insurance policy qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, the final amount received on maturity is tax-free as per Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act.

Public Provident Fund (PPF)
PPF is a very commonly heard term among taxpayers. PPF falls under the exempt tax status, hence the reason for its popularity. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office. PPF accounts can be opened with a bank or post office, but they can also be transferred from one branch to another or from post office to bank and vice versa.

The amount invested during the financial year for the PPF qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The interest and the maturity amount are exempt from tax under section 10 of the Income Tax Act. The PPF account lock-in tenure is 15 years.

Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is one of the essential tax-saving investment options. Launched under the government’s “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” campaign, SSY focuses on improving girl-child life. The scheme allows the taxpayer to deposit some amount in the account regularly and earn interest simultaneously. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana also qualifies for deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The minimum amount is Rs.250, and the scheme matures 21 years or till the girl child gets married, whichever is earlier after the account opening.

Interest accrues on the SSY Account, which gets compounded annually, is eligible for tax exemption under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

Maturity proceeds or any withdrawal amount is also exempt from tax under section 10(11A) of the Income Tax Act.

National Savings Certificate (NSC)
National Saving Certificate is a fixed-income investment scheme that is aimed at small- and middle-income investors. NSC is a good tax-saving investment option as the risk is low and is as secure as the provident fund. Moreover, the investment in NSC qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

The interest earned is also added back to the initial investment and is eligible for tax exemption.

The features of the NSC tax-saving investment option are as follows:

A guaranteed return of 6.8% annual interest.
A tax benefit of up to Rs. 1.5Lakh
Investment can be made as low as Rs. 1,000 (or multiples of Rs. 100)
The investor will receive the entire maturity value, which will be taxed to the taxpayer.
Senior Citizen Saving Scheme
As the name suggests, the Senior Citizen Saving scheme is available to senior citizens who are residents of India. This scheme offers one of the highest rates among the various saving schemes. Although this scheme's lock-in period is five years, the depositors can extend the maturity period by another three years. Moreover, the depositors can make investments with a minimum amount of Rs.1000 and multiples thereof.

The Senior Citizen Saving Scheme investment qualifies for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.50 lakh under Section 80C. The interest on such deposits is taxable and liable for tax if the interest exceeds Rs. 50,000.

Bank FDs
Fixed deposits are considered one of the risk-free tax saving investment schemes. The bank decides the interest rate on a minimum lock-in period of five years. In the scenario of a joint account, the primary holder can avail of the benefit of tax deduction while calculating the taxable income. Additionally, senior citizens get the maximum benefits from a higher interest rate on investment. Premature withdrawal is not allowed in the tax-saver bank fixed deposits.

Investors can claim a maximum deduction of Rs. 1.5 Lakh by investing in a tax-saving FD A/c.

Interest earned from Saving Accounts Deposits under 80 TTA
All taxpayers can avail of a tax deduction on the interest generated from savings account deposits within limits. This interest can be from savings accounts in banks, post offices, or accounts in cooperative societies involved in the banking business. This tax-saving investment option is for ordinary taxpayers, not senior citizens.

The maximum deduction limit is Rs. 10,000 under this section, which includes the interest earned from all the savings accounts one has. Beyond this limit, any interest earned will be taxable.

Under Section 80TTB, the benefit of the least tax implication on interest income is provided for a senior citizen. Under this section, a deduction up to Rs. 50,000 or an amount from a particular income is allowed from the total gross income.

Interest paid toward the repayment of the Education Loan
Under Section 80E, students who take education loans to fulfill their education dreams are offered a tax exemption on the interest repayment. There is no cap on the deduction to be claimed. Tax deduction claims can be made from the start of the year when the payer starts paying the interest on the education loan and within the seven immediately subsequent financial years or until the interest is completely paid, whichever is earlier.

Premium paid toward the Health Insurance Policies or incurred medical expenses in case of senior citizens
The total taxable income towards the premium paid on Health insurance and expenses incurred towards healthcare is allowed for tax deductions under Section 80D. The limit to claim this deduction depends on the taxpayer’s family situation:-



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Eligibility                                                   | Exemption Limit                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Health insurance for self and family (spouse and children)    | Rs. 25,000                             |
| For self and family + parents                                 | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 25,000 = Rs. 50,000   |
| For self and family (below 60 years) + Parents above 60 years | Rs. 25,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 75,000   |
| For self and family (with members above 60 years) +           | Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 |
| senior citizen parents                                        |                                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interest Paid toward Home Loan
Under Section 24 (b), interest payments toward home loans can be claimed. The maximum limit that a taxpayer gets on the interest payment of a home loan is Rs. 2 lakhs if the house property is self-occupied.

Further, in those cases where the home loan taken for the property is not self-occupied but instead is rented, there is no limit on maximum tax deductions. A deduction can be taken on the whole interest amount.

Payouts on the maturity of the Life Insurance Plan
As per section 10(10D), all the incomes received from a life insurance plan upon maturity, surrender, or death of the policyholder are tax-free.

Exemption of House Rent paid (if mentioned in salary break-up)
If there is no HRA added to your salary break-up because you work in some small, medium-sized companies. In this case, you can claim deductions on the rent paid for furnished/unfurnished accommodation as per Section 80GG. The same rule applies to self-employed people, too. The conditions to claim the deductions are:-

Must not have received HRA during any part of the fiscal year
Should not be possessing any house in the city of occupation
Individuals should not own a house in the city of occupation in the name of spouse, minor child, or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) of which the person is a member.
Owning a house in any other city different from the occupation city is eligible for deductions, but it shouldn’t be self-occupied or left vacant.
The amount of deduction under this provision exempts up to the lowest value of the listed parameters:

The rent paid more than 10% of the total income
25% of the total income after adjustment
a maximum of ₹5,000 per month.
Hence, the maximum deduction allowed during the year is ₹60,000.

Deduction of House Rent paid (if not mentioned in salary break-up)
Under Section 10(13A) Income Tax Act offers tax benefits in the minimum value of the following:-

Actual annual rent allowance disbursed by the employer
50% of the basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) if the house is situated in metro cities or 40% of the Basic Salary plus DA if the house is situated in other cities.
Actual rent paid for the house – 10% of basic pay plus DA.
In the above calculations, DA will be considered if it forms a part of retirement benefits.

Donations made to Charitable Institutions
Deductions can be claimed for the donations made to approved charitable institutions under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. The condition is that the donation should have been made by any mode other than cash, as cash donations exceeding Rs. 2,000 do not qualify as deductions.

Further, to claim this deduction, a taxpayer needs a stamped receipt from the institution they have made the donation, with details of the name of the trust, address, PAN Number of the Trust, the amount of donation, etc.

Donations to Scientific Research and Rural Development
Taxpayers can claim deductions under Section 80GGA for the donations made for scientific research and rural development. There is no cap, and 100% of the income spent is eligible for the deduction, provided the transaction is made via a bank account if the donation exceeds Rs. 10,000/-.

Donations to Political Parties
Under Section 80GGC, the entire income spent on the donation towards political parties is waived off from tax calculations, provided the transaction is made via a bank account. Also, the political party to which the donation is made must be registered under Section 29A of the Representation of People Act (RPA) of 1951.

Medical expenses for the disabled person
Under Section 80DD, individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) can claim deductions of the amount spent for the treatment and well-being of a disabled dependent family member. However, this claim is offered only to the legal family of such dependent individuals.

Based on the percentage of disability, if people have 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If people have disabilities, more than 80% can, they claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Flat Deduction for Disabled Person on the Basis of Severity of Disability
Under Section 80U, the disabled individual can claim tax deductions if a registered medical authority documents the disability with a minimum 40% impairment.

If the disabled individual has 40-80% disability, they can claim a deduction of up to Rs. 75,000.

If individuals have disabilities of more than 80%, they can claim up to Rs. 1.25 Lakh inclusive of all related expenses.

Individuals Diagnosed With Specific Diseases or Disability
Under Section 80DDB, individuals can claim exemptions on subsequent income spent on the treatment of dependent family members diagnosed with specific diseases. These critical illnesses include neurological disorders, AIDS, chronic renal disease, malignant cancers, and hematological ailments. For individuals below 60, a maximum of Rs. 40,000 is disbursed, and the same increases to Rs. 1 lakh for senior and super senior citizens.

Interest Earned on Deposits by Senior Citizens
Senior citizens take a heavy charge on their finances because of the expenditure on medical expenses. Relaxation from tax deductions helps senior citizens to simplify their lives. Under Section 80 TTB, senior citizens aged 60 years and above can claim Rs. 50,000 or a specified amount as a deduction from their gross total income for that fiscal year.

How to Plan your Tax Saving Investments for the Year?
Planning your tax-saving investments for the year requires strategic thinking to ensure you meet your financial goals while reducing your tax liability. Here's how to plan effectively:

Understand Your Tax Liability

Review your total taxable income and estimate the tax liability based on the applicable tax slab.
Identify areas where you can claim deductions or exemptions to reduce taxable income.
Choose the Right Investment Tools

Section 80C: Invest in options like PPF, ELSS, NSC, or Tax-saving FD, which offer up to ₹1.5 lakh in deductions.
National Pension Scheme (NPS): Contributions to NPS are eligible for additional deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) up to ₹50,000.
Health Insurance (Section 80D): Premiums paid for health insurance can give you deductions, which is beneficial for families and senior citizens.
Home Loan Repayment (Section 80C and 24B): Claim deductions on principal repayment and interest paid on home loans.
Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance

Select investments according to your risk appetite—ELSS funds for aggressive investors or PPF for a safer, long-term bet.
Consider mixing different investment types to balance growth and risk.
Plan for Long-Term Goals

Focus on long-term growth instruments such as NPS or PPF to not only save tax but also secure your retirement and long-term financial goals.
Avoid frequent withdrawal from tax-saving instruments to maximize growth.
Consider Tax-Free Income

Invest in tax-free instruments like the Public Provident Fund (PPF) or tax-free bonds that generate interest without adding to your tax burden.
Monitor and Adjust Your Portfolio

Regularly review your investments to make sure they align with your changing tax and financial needs.
Rebalance your portfolio annually, especially if tax-saving limits are reached or if tax laws change.
Make Investments Before the Deadline

Be mindful of the deadlines, typically before the end of the financial year (31st March), to claim deductions for the current year.

Home Loan Tax Benefit - How To Save Income Tax On Your Home Loan?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

5 min read


If you are acquiring a home by taking a loan, then you can claim deductions on interest portion that you repay as a part of EMI, in accordance with the regulations of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 

While obtaining a housing loan can be costly, it is also possible to benefit from several tax deductions that can help you save money on taxes each year. It is important to understand how to maximize these benefits.

Home Loan Tax Benefit
Impact of New Tax Regime on Home Loan Benefits
Home Loan benefits under the old tax regime remain the same as one can avail deductions without any restrictions, however, the under new tax regime benefits are curtailed, let’s know in detail about the same

Deduction under section 80C for the payment towards principal component of the home loan, stamp duty, registration charges and Section 80EE, Section 80EEA are not available
Deduction under section 24(b) for the payment towards the interest component of the home loan is not available for self-occupied property.
However, deduction under section 24b is available for let-out property. If net income from let out property results in loss, then such loss will be allowed to set off against profit from another house property but not allowed to set off against other heads of income like salary or other sources.
Deduction for Interest Paid on Housing Loan under Section 24
A loan must be taken for the purchase or construction of a house property to claim a tax deduction. If it is taken for the construction of a house, then construction must be completed within five years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken.

The interest portion of the home loan EMI for the year can be claimed as a deduction from your total income up to a maximum of Rs 2 lakh under Section 24. 

From the assessment year 2018-19 onwards, the maximum deduction for interest paid on self-occupied house property is Rs 2 lakh.

For let out property, there is no upper limit for claiming tax exemption on interest, which means that you can claim deduction on the entire interest paid on your home loan. 

In case the construction exceeds the stipulated time, i.e. 5 years, you can claim deductions on interest of home loan only up to Rs 30,000 for the financial year.

ITR Filing Last Date 2024
The last date to file Income Tax Return (ITR) for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) without a late fee is 31st July 2024.

Deduction on Interest Paid Towards Home Loan During the Pre-Construction Period
Say you bought an under-construction property and have not moved in yet but you are paying the EMIs. In this case, your eligibility to claim interest on the home loan as a deduction begins only upon completion of construction or immediately if you buy a fully constructed property. 

So, does this mean you would not enjoy any tax benefits on the interest paid during the period falling between the borrowing of loan and completion of construction? Yes, it will be available but with some conditions and in future years.

Let’s understand how. 

The Income Tax Act allows you to claim a deduction for such interest, which is also called pre-construction interest. You are allowed to deduct it in five equal instalments starting from the year the property is acquired or construction is completed, over and above the deduction you are otherwise eligible to claim from your house property income. However, the maximum eligibility remains capped at Rs 2 lakh.

For example, you availed a home loan in April 2021 for construction and paid an interest of Rs 10,000 a month. Construction of the house was completed in April 2023 after two years. Hence, you can start claiming the pre-construction interest of Rs 2.4 lakh (approx) paid by you only after the construction gets completed in five equal instalments starting from the year 2023-24. Maximum interest deduction under Section 24(b) is capped at Rs 2 lakh (including current year interest + pre-construction interest). So if you paid interest of Rs. 1,20,000 during the year 2023-24 then you can claim a total interest deduction of Rs. 1,68,000 (i.e., Rs. 1,20,000 as current year interest and Rs. 48,000 as 1/5th installment of pre-construction interest).

Further, if your home loan is eligible for deduction under Section 80EEA, you can claim an additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh over and above the limit of Rs. 2 lakhs u/s 24(b). We have discussed Section 80EEA later in this article.

Deduction on Principal Repayment under Section 80C
The principal paid on the home loan EMI for the year is allowed as a deduction under section 80C. The maximum amount that can be claimed under this section is up to Rs 1.5 lakh.

But to claim this deduction, the house property should not be sold within five years of possession. Otherwise, the deduction claimed earlier will be added back to your income in the year of sale.

Deduction for Stamp Duty and Registration Charges under Section 80C
Besides claiming the deduction for principal repayment, a deduction for stamp duty and registration charges can also be claimed under Section 80C but within the overall limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. 

However, it can be claimed only in the year these expenses are incurred.

Additional Deduction under Section 80EE
Additional deduction under Section 80EE is allowed to the home buyers for a maximum of up to Rs 50,000. To claim this deduction, the following conditions should be met:

The amount of loan taken should be Rs 35 lakh or less, and the property’s value shall not exceed Rs 50 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2017.
And on the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first-time house owner.
Additional Deduction under Section 80EEA
To promote the housing sector, Budget 2019 has introduced an additional deduction under Section 80EEA for homebuyers for a maximum of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. 

To claim this deduction, below mentioned conditions should be met:

The stamp value of the property does not exceed Rs 45 lakh.
The loan must have been sanctioned between 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022 (extended from 31 March 2021)
On the date of loan sanction, the individual does not own any other house, i.e. first time home buyer.
The individual should not be eligible to claim a deduction under Section 80EEA if claiming a deduction under Section 80EE.
Deduction for Joint Home Loan
If the loan is taken jointly, each loan holder can claim a deduction for home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh each and principal repayment under Section 80C up to Rs 1.5 lakh each in their tax returns.

To claim this deduction, they should also be co-owners of the property taken on loan. So, a loan taken jointly with your family member can help you claim a larger tax benefit.

Loss under the Head House Property
If you have not let-out any of your house property then there are high chances that you might incur a loss under the head house property, reason being the interest deduction that you might avail u/s 24(b). Further, even if you have rented out the property, you can incur a loss under the head house property because there is no limit on interest on home loan deductions so your interest can exceed your rental income.

If you have incurred a loss above Rs. 2 lakhs then you cannot set off such losses during the current year, but you are allowed to carry forward such losses for 8 years and claim the same against your income from house property in future years.

About NPS
NPS, or National Pension System, is a government-sponsored pension scheme available to both salaried and self-employed individuals. It offers dual benefit:

Tax savings during your working years
A regular income stream after retirement 
NPS is one of the most popular options for individuals seeking to create a retirement corpus and a regular monthly income. The money deposited in NPS is invested in various securities and investment avenues, including the equity market. It is widely regarded as one of the cheapest investment options with equity exposure. As the returns are directly related to the market performance, there is no guarantee of any particular amount. Still, over a period of time, returns from NPS have been among the highest in the market.

Two Types of NPS Accounts
There are two types of accounts in NPS, NPS Tier 1 and NPS Tier 2.

Tier 1 Account (Pension Account):This has a fixed lock-in period until the subscriber reaches the age of 60 years. Only partial withdrawal is allowed, with certain conditions. Contributions made towards Tier 1 are tax deductible and qualify for deductions under Section 80CCD(1) and Section 80CCD(1B). This means you can invest up to Rs. 2 lakhs in an NPS Tier 1 account and claim a deduction for the full amount, i.e. Rs. 1.50 lakh under Sec 80CCD(1) and Rs. 50,000/- under Section 80CCD(1B).
Tier 2 Account (Additional Account): This is a voluntary savings account that allows subscribers to make withdrawals as and when they like. Only the contributions made by a Central government employee to a Tier 2 account are eligible for tax deduction. To open a Tier 2 account, you must open a Tier 1 account first. The deposits made in the NPS Tier II accounts are eligible for an income tax deduction, under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, for government employees. On the other hand, there is no income tax deduction offered on NPS Tier II deposits for private-sector employees and the gains in the NPS Tier 2 are taxable at the respective slab rates.
Eligibility under Section 80CCD(1B)
An individual taxpayer is eligible to claim deduction under Section 80CCD(1B) by filing the income tax return under the old tax regime. 

However, there is an age restriction for opening an NPS account. The following individuals can open NPS:

Resident individuals between 18-70 years  
Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) aged between 18-70 years. However, if NRI’s citizenship changes after investing in NPS, the scheme will be terminated.

Things to Note while Claiming Deductions Under Section 80CCD(1B)
Here are some of the critical points about Section 80CCD(1B) that you should be aware of:

Individuals must file their taxes under the old tax regime, i.e., opting out of the applicability of sec 115BAC(1A).
The additional deduction of Rs. 50,000/- is available only for contributions made to NPS Tier 1 accounts
Tier 2 accounts are not eligible to claim the deduction under Section 80CCD(1B)
The deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) are available to salaried individuals as well as to self-employed individuals
You need to produce documentary evidence of the transaction related to the contribution to NPS
Partial withdrawals are allowed under NPS but are subject to specific terms and conditions
The total exemption limit under Section 80CCD(1B) is Rs. 50,000/- and is independent of exemptions under Section 80C. Thereby, you can claim a maximum deduction of  Rs. 2 lakhs
In case the assessee dies and the nominee decides to close the NPS account, then the amount received by the nominee is exempt from taxation
Documents Required to Claim Tax Benefit Under NPS

The following documents are required to be submitted while investing in NPS:

Bank account statement
PAN card
Aadhaar card
Taxation on NPS Withdrawal

If partial withdrawals are made from the account, then only 25% of the contribution made is exempt from taxation. If the assessee is an employee and decides to close the NPS account or opt out of NPS, then only 40% of the total amount is tax-exempt. The assessee can withdraw 60% of the entire amount upon reaching the age of 60 as tax-free income. The remaining 40% is also tax-free if it is used to purchase an annuity plan. 

Section 80CCD(1B) offers you an excellent opportunity to save a substantial amount on your taxation liabilities. This way, you can not only reduce your present tax liabilities but also work towards creating a substantial corpus for your retirement. Remember the points mentioned above, taking any action related to your NPS account regarding Section 80CCD(1B).

The purpose of the Public Provident Fund (PPF), which was first implemented in India in 1968, was to mobilise small contributions for investment and return. It can also be referred to as an investment vehicle that enables one to accumulate retirement funds while reducing yearly taxes. Anyone looking for a safe investment option to save taxes and earn guaranteed returns should open a PPF account.


How Important is PPF?
The PPF (Public Provident Fund) is considered an excellent investment option, especially for people uncomfortable with taking risks. While the returns may not be very high because they depend on the market, they offer stability. Additionally, investing in PPF can help diversify your portfolio and has tax benefits.


However, please note that to receive interest on your PPF investments, they must be made on or before the 5th of each month, as the interest is calculated on the lowest balance at the credit of account between the close of the fifth day and the end of the month. 

What is PPF Account?
PPF – Key Information
Interest Rate	7.1% per annum.
Minimum Investment Amount	Rs.500
Maximum Investment Amount	Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.
Tenure	15 years
Risk Profile	Offers guaranteed, risk-free returns
Tax Benefit	Up to Rs.1.5 lakh under Section 80C
Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme is a long-term investment option that offers an attractive rate of interest and returns on the amount invested. The interest earned and the returns are not taxable under Income Tax. One has to open a PPF account under this scheme and the amount deposited during a year will be claimed under section 80C deductions.

Features of PPF account
Below are the essential features of PPF

Tenure: The PPF has a minimum tenure of 15 years, which can be extended in blocks of 5 years as per your wish.
Investment limits: PPF allows a minimum investment of Rs 500 and a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh for each financial year. Investments can be made in a lump sum or in a maximum of 12 instalments.
Opening balance: The account can be opened with just Rs 100 a month. Annual investments above Rs 1.5 lakh will not earn interest and will not be eligible for tax savings.
Deposit frequency: Deposits into a PPF account have to be made at least once every year for 15 years.
Mode of deposit: The deposit into a PPF account can be made either by way of cash, cheque, demand draft (DD) or through an online fund transfer.
Nomination: A PPF account holder can designate a nominee for his account either at the time of opening the account or subsequently.
Joint accounts: A PPF account can be held only in the name of one individual. Opening an account in joint names is not allowed.
Risk factor: Since PPF is backed by the Indian government, it offers guaranteed, risk-free returns as well as complete capital protection. The element of risk involved in holding a PPF account is minimal. As the returns from PPF accounts are fixed, they are used as a diversification tool for the investor’s portfolio. 
Tax benefit: The PPF interest and maturity amount are tax-free under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Partial withdrawal: PPF amount can be withdrawn partially from the 5th financial year onwards.
What is PPF Interest Rate?
The PPF interest rate for 2024-25 is 7.1% p.a., which is compounded annually. 
However, to receive the PPF interest for the deposit month, it is very important that you deposit your PPF amount within 5th of that month.


The Finance Ministry sets the interest rate every year, which is paid on 31st March. The interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the 5th day and the last day of every month. Thus, if you invest in PPF after the 5th day of the month, it will not be considered for interest calculation, and the balance which is there on the 5th day will be taken into consideration.

In a nutshell, the PPF contribution made on the 5th of a month will earn interest for that month, while any PPF contribution made after the 5th of the month will not earn interest and result in a loss of interest for that month.

Further, use our PPF calculator to figure out the returns you can expect on investing a certain amount in a PPF account.

PPF vs Mutual Funds
The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a savings scheme provided by the government, which offers guaranteed returns. However, there are other investment options available, such as mutual funds, that also offer tax-saving advantages. Mutual funds are investment vehicles that distribute funds among different types of assets, like stocks and bonds. They gather money from multiple investors and make strategic investments in securities.


Mutual funds have the potential to provide higher returns and greater liquidity compared to PPF. They are classified into different categories based on the asset class, such as equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. It's worth noting that only Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) among mutual funds are eligible for tax savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

Mutual funds have a proven history of delivering returns that have surpassed the market, making them a widely chosen investment option. Each category of mutual funds has its investment objective and level of risk.

Which is a Better Option: PPF or FD?
Public Provident Funds (PPF) and Fixed Deposits (FDs) provide guaranteed returns in the form of interest. However, there are significant differences between the two:

Tenure: FDs offer flexible tenures ranging from as short as 7 days to as long as 10 years, giving investors the freedom to select a duration that aligns with their preferences. On the contrary, PPF has a fixed tenure of 15 years, providing a stable and long-term savings option.

Taxation: PPF provides tax-free returns, while FDs are subject to taxation, including TDS.

Interest Rates: FD interest rates are determined by individual banks and can vary from one bank to another. Moreover, senior citizens often receive preferential treatment with higher interest rates on their FDs than regular citizens.

Loan Options: PPF allows for loans against the account, but the maximum loan amount is limited to 25% of the balance after 1 year. On the other hand, FDs also provide the option to take loans, allowing borrowers to access up to 90% of their deposit amount. The interest rate on an FD loan is usually 1-2 percentage points higher than the prevailing FD interest rate.

Loan Types: FDs can serve as collateral for different types of loans, such as home loans, business loans, and education loans, among others. The bank and the specific loan type determine the loan interest rate.

Is LIC better than Public Provident Fund?
There is often confusion regarding the difference between investment and insurance. Insurance protects against risks, while investment aims to secure a stable financial future. Investors must prioritise their financial well-being by maintaining an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses, obtaining insurance coverage for protection against accidents or unforeseen events, and saving for a secure future.

Having insurance is crucial for investors who have dependents relying on their income. There are different types of insurance schemes available, including term insurance, ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans), and endowment plans. However, it is advisable to prioritise a term insurance policy for adequate coverage and consider investing in a PPF for long-term savings.

A cost-effective approach to combining insurance and investment security is by opting for a term insurance policy along with a PPF. Rather than comparing the superiority of LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) and PPF, the emphasis should be on selecting an appropriate term policy that complements the PPF and meets your insurance needs.

Insurance plans with investment options like ULIPs can indeed have high expense ratios and hidden charges. Therefore, it is generally recommended to separate investment and insurance needs. Choosing a term insurance policy alongside investing in a PPF is a prudent strategy that allows individuals to enjoy the benefits of insurance and investment without unnecessary complexities. This approach ensures a clear and straightforward approach to meet both objectives effectively.

Public Provident Fund (PPF) Limitations
PPF accounts do have certain drawbacks that should be considered:

1. Lock-in Period: PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years, which is longer than other tax-saving investments like Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) with a lock-in period of just three years. This extended lock-in period can pose challenges in case of emergencies or when there is a need for funds during the investment period. As discussed earlier, premature withdrawals are allowed in PPF, but there are restrictions and regulations on when and how much you can withdraw. Therefore, it's important to ensure that you can commit to investing in a PPF account for 15 years.

2. Moderate Interest Rate: The interest rate offered on PPF accounts is not very high, especially considering it is a long-term investment scheme. In contrast, ELSS has the potential to provide double-digit returns to investors.

3. No Joint Holding: PPF accounts cannot be held jointly, which can be a limitation if you intend to open a joint account with your spouse or other family members.

4. Investment Limit: The maximum amount that can be invested in a PPF account in a year is ₹1.5 lakh. However, there is no limit to the amount you can invest in other tax-saving instruments like ELSS funds, NPS, or FDs, although the maximum tax benefit that can be claimed remains the same at ₹1.5 lacks under Section 80C.

5. NRI Restrictions: While resident Indians can open new PPF accounts, this option is unavailable for NRIs. If you had a PPF account as a resident Indian and have become an NRI, you can continue making deposits into the account, but you cannot open new PPF accounts.


6. Annual Contribution Requirement: PPF mandates a minimum annual contribution to keep the account active. Failing to contribute the minimum amount can lead to the account becoming inactive, and reactivating it requires paying a penalty.

Considering these drawbacks, it is important to carefully evaluate your financial goals and circumstances before investing in a PPF account.

Conclusion 
If you prefer low-risk investments and value the security provided by government-backed instruments, PPF can be a suitable choice.
